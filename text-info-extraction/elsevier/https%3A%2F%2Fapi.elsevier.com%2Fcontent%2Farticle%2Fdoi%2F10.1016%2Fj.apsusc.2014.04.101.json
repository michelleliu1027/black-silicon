Graphical abstract Based on a combination of RIE nano-texturing and the conventional micro-texturing processes, an improved double-texturing process is reported. This paper explains its successful implementation using low-cost inline-diffusion and non-acidic \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 etch-back technology and elimination of any RIE-related damage removal etching step. This optimised double-textured post-diffused SWS surface does not affect minority carrier lifetime and has WAR of 3.2% after SiNx ARC deposition, which is significantly lower than that of conventional acidic-textured (WAR of 6\u20137%) 156mm2, industrial-grade, p-type multi-Si wafers. SEM micrographs of the double-textured SWS multi-Si surface: (a) magnification: 15000\u00d7, (b) magnification: 35000\u00d7. Left: front surface reflectance as a function of wavelength for double and micro-textured multi-Si wafers before and after SiNx ARC deposition. One of the main restrictions on further enhancement of the multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) wafer solar cell efficiency is the high reflectance loss from the front surface. Double-texturing, including a micro-texturing by conventional isotropic acidic-texturing followed by nano-texturing using sub-wavelength structures (SWS), provides a possibility to remove this limitation. However, presently available double-texturing processes involve multiple and high-cost nano-texturing process steps and thus have not become industrially viable. This study presents an improved double-texturing process and reports its successful implementation using low-cost inline-diffusion and non-acidic \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 etch-back technology. The process is based on reactive ion etching (RIE) as a metal-free nano-texturing step, along with the conventional acidic iso-texturing process. The process is optimised based on effective minority carrier lifetime and weighted average reflectance (WAR) measurements, on 156\u00d7156mm2, industrial-grade, p-type multi-Si wafers. This optimised double-textured SWS surface has a WAR of 3.2% after silicon nitride deposition, which is significantly lower than that of conventional acidic iso-textured wafers (WAR of 6\u20137%). However, this optimised surface maintains the same values of the effective minority carrier lifetime as for the reference conventional acidic-textured multi-Si wafers. The optimised nano-texturing recipe is also successfully applied to alkaline-textured monocrystalline silicon wafers. Keywords Multicrystalline silicon wafer solar cells Sub-wavelength structure RIE etching SERIS etch Simultaneous damage removal etching and etch back Lifetime analysis 1 Introduction The worldwide photovoltaic (PV) production is presently dominated by multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) wafer solar cells and its demand is increasing each year [1]. However, industrial multi-Si solar cells have lower efficiencies than monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) solar cells. One of the major contributors to this lower efficiency is the lack of a viable, high-performance multi-Si texturing process, comparable to the standard alkaline pyramidal texturing [2,3] used on its mono-Si counterparts. Lower performance front surface texturing is associated with higher reflection losses from the solar cell surface, resulting in a loss in short-circuit current density (J sc). For <100> oriented mono-Si wafers, anisotropic texturing in an alkaline/alcohol wet chemical solution generates random pyramid structures due to the preferential etching of the <100> crystal orientation over the <111> crystal orientation [3,4]. However, the random nature of crystal orientation of multi-Si wafers does not allow uniform formation of such structures. Presently, isotropic texturing in acidic wet chemical solutions is used in the PV industry for multi-Si surface texturing [5], resulting in a scalloped surface with rounded features. However, this texturing is not as effective at lowering surface reflectance as alkaline texturing on mono-Si. Generally, alkaline textured mono-Si and acidic textured multi-Si wafers have their weighted average reflectance (WAR) in the range of 2\u20133% and 6\u20137% in air, respectively [3,5], after deposition of an anti-reflection coating (ARC) of silicon nitride (SiNx). Here, WAR is weighted using the Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) solar spectrum over the 300\u20131000nm wavelength range. As a \u201cdry\u201d (i.e. no wet chemistry) alternative for the isotropic multi-Si texturing process, reactive ion etching (RIE) has received increasing attention in recent years [6\u201311] to further reduce reflection losses from multi-Si wafer solar cells. Its main benefits are very low reflectance losses, the possibility of single-side texturing, reduced material loss, and reduction of chemical waste [6\u201311]. However, challenges associated with increased surface recombination (due to increased surface area) and relatively high equipment costs have been a barrier for the implementation of RIE texturing in most commercial solar cell production lines [9\u201311]. Moreover, during RIE texturing, nano-spikes are formed on the Si-surface, which typically requires an additional pre-diffusion acidic or alkaline process to eliminate the detrimental effect of the nano-spikes on the solar cell electrical parameters [7,8,12]. This process is referred to as damage removal etching (DRE). Another alternate low reflecting Si surface is generated by a new type of textured surface, known specifically as sub-wavelength structure (SWS) [13\u201319]. This structure involves textured surfaces with features smaller than the wavelength of light of interest, which acts as surface-relief grating [13]. It behaves as an anti-reflecting surface which can suppress the Fresnel reflection substantially over a wide spectral bandwidth and a large field of view (i.e. a wide range of incident angles) [13\u201315]. Given these advantages, the SWS have been applied to light emitting diodes [16], lasers [17], optical elements [18] and transparent glasses [19]. Due to its wide-angle and wide-band anti-reflecting properties, researchers have investigated its possible use for PV applications [20\u201323]. Several techniques, such as laser-interference lithography, nano-imprinting [20], and metal-assisted etching [23\u201326] have been applied to fabricate SWS structures on the front surface of Si solar cells. Recently, a combination of micro-texturing (acidic or alkaline) and nano-texturing processes, referred to as \u2018double-texturing\u2019 in the following text, has gained significant interest among researchers [26\u201329] due to its potential to further decrease the emitter surface reflectance. Xiu et al. [26] deposited a thin discontinuous layer of gold (Au) nanoparticles by electron-beam evaporation onto micro-textured (alkaline textured) mono-Si wafers. The nanostructures, formed after Au etching, yielded WAR values in air of 3.8%. Chang et al. [27] deposited indium-tin-oxide nano-whiskers by electron-beam evaporation on tube-diffused alkaline textured c-Si wafers after ARC SiNx deposition and reported an increase of J sc due to the increase in the cell's long-wavelength spectral response. Toor et al. [28] applied a wet chemical deposition of Au and used metal etching to form nano-structures on pyramidal mono-Si wafer surfaces to improve the blue response of the solar cell, while Dimitrov et al. [29] generated nanotextures on pyramidally textured mono-Si wafers using electroless deposition of silver (Ag) nanoparticles followed by Ag etching. Despite the low reflectance achieved by the double-texture methods reviewed above, they all have the drawback of requiring deposition of costly, sacrificial metals and subsequent wet chemical metal etching processes. The use of metals presents the potential for undesirable metallic contamination of the wafer surface before the subsequent high-temperature diffusion, thereby requiring an additional pre-diffusion surface cleaning process. These features ultimately combine to reduce the industrial applicability of metal based double-texturing. Of importance to the context of the present paper, these processes have only been applied on mono-Si wafers. In the present paper we report a novel, metal-free and non-acidic double-texturing approach and apply it to inline-diffused 156mm square multi-Si and 156mm pseudo-square mono-Si p-type wafers. The micro-texturing is performed by a standard acidic solution for multi-Si [5] or alkaline solution for mono-Si [3], while the nano-texturing is accomplished by RIE without requiring any pre-diffusion DRE step. The proposed process successfully incorporates three novel concepts. Firstly, no pre-diffusion DRE is applied to the RIE nano-textured surface; secondly, low-cost inline diffusion is applied to the final RIE -textured Si surface; thirdly, a single-step non-acidic emitter etch-back process, the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019, is applied to perform simultaneous post-diffusion DRE. Following this method, the final \u2018double-textured\u2019 emitter surface is obtained. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a detailed surface morphology study is carried out on wafers textured using a range of RIE texturing conditions. The double-textured surface is further optimised via an effective minority carrier lifetime study on symmetric samples. They were prepared using an inline-diffused emitter, DRE/etch-back [30] and a densified dielectric surface passivation stack on both sides of the wafers. The optimised double-textured multi-Si wafers yield a WAR value of 3.2% (after diffusion and SiNx ARC deposition) and show a decreased surface reflectance both in the short and long wavelength range of the useable solar spectrum. 2 Experimental details 2.1 Optimisation of the double-textured inline-diffused emitters 2.1.1 Formation of micro-textured surface For the industrial-grade multi-Si wafers (156mm square, boron doped, p-type, 1.1\u20131.2\u03a9cm resistivity, \u223c160\u2013180\u03bcm thick), a standard wet-chemical acidic-texturing (i.e., micro-texturing) step was performed in an industrial inline wet chemical process tool (RENA, InPilot). The process consisted of three major steps. Firstly, isotropic texturing was carried out with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid (HF), nitric acid (HNO3) and de-ionised (DI) water at a temperature of 7\u20138\u00b0C. Secondly, the parasitic porous silicon produced during iso-texturing was removed using 5% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution at a temperature of 20\u00b0C. Finally, the wafers were cleaned in a hydrochloric (HCl)-HF solution to remove any metal contamination left by the KOH solution. The wafers were then rinsed with DI water and dried. For mono-Si wafers (156mm pseudo-square, Cz, boron doped, p-type, <100> orientation, \u223c1\u03a9cm resistivity, \u223c170\u2013190\u03bcm thick), the micro-texturing (i.e., alkaline-texturing) process started with saw damage etching in sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)-KOH solution [31], followed by texturing in an alcoholic alkaline solution at 80\u00b0C [3] to generate a random and laterally uniform pyramidal texture. After texturing, all wafers were neutralised in 1:1 HCl and DI water solution at 60\u00b0C for 10min, followed by a dip in dilute 5% HF solution, DI rinsing and drying. 2.1.2 Formation of nano-textured surface The nano-texturing for both types of wafers was performed by RIE in a MPS 2200 Mini-Plasma system (JLS Designs). The process was optimised by varying the plasma power, chamber pressure, the ratio between the sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and oxygen (O2) process gases, and the Si etching time. The chamber size allowed processing of four wafers simultaneously in each run. 2.1.3 Fabrication of lifetime samples for process optimisation In order to investigate the impact of the texturing on the effective lifetime, symmetrical lifetime test structures were fabricated. As a reference group, micro-textured (acidic-textured) multi-Si wafers were processed together with the double-textured samples. An industrial inline diffusion furnace (Despatch, DCF-3615) was used with a phosphoric acid (H3PO4) dopant source. After an atmospheric plasma pre-treatment step at the entry to the doper (to form a hydrophilic Si surface), a spray-on H3PO4: ethyl alcohol dopant source was applied uniformly to both sides of the wafer at a rate of 30cm3/minute (min). The diffusion was performed at a belt speed of 390mm/min using a peak diffusion temperature of 894\u00b0C to achieve a sheet resistance (R sq) of \u223c40\u03a9/square (sq). After removal of the phosphosilicate glass (PSG) in a dilute HF solution, all wafers underwent simultaneous DRE and emitter etch-back using the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 solution [30,32] (discussed separately in Section 2.1.4 below) to achieve a target R sq of \u223c70\u03a9/sq. The process was completed by deposition of a 70nm thick ARC SiNx layer (refractive index of 2.05 at 633nm) on both surfaces by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD, SiNA-XS, Roth & Rau) followed by fast firing in an industrial belt furnace (Despatch, UltraFlex). A fabrication process flow for the preparation of the lifetime samples for the double-textured and standard micro (acidic)-textured multi-Si wafers is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.1.4 SERIS-etch emitter etch-back and simultaneous DRE Inline diffusion (ILD), in a multi-lane belt or roller furnace, using H3PO4 solutions as the dopant source enables high throughput per tool. However, the short diffusion time, open ended furnace, lower-grade chemical precursors and the metal belt generate their own additional disadvantages. Surface dead layer (due to surface contaminants and a high dopant concentration at the surface) and very shallow junction [33,34] are formed, which limits the open-circuit voltage (V oc) and efficiency of ILD emitter solar cells. To address these constraints, ILD is commonly performed on both sides of the Si wafer to generate two benefits: (i) minimisation of back surface contamination from the metallic conveyor belt [35], and (ii) enhancement of phosphorous (P) gettering [36]. After removal of the PSG layer in diluted HF solution, rod-like structures have been observed on ILD emitter surfaces [37]. Horzel et al. [37] proposed that these \u2018anomalous\u2019 structures are formed during rapid cooling of the dopant solution (H3PO4 and solvent) with a formation of silicon phosphide (SiP) precipitates and it involves very high P concentrations above the solid solubility limit of P in Si. In order to remove potential contamination from the metallic conveyor belt, and also to etch off this heavily doped dead layer along with the SiP precipitates, stripping of this top layer is necessary. Various cleaning or etching processes have been developed by different research groups to remove the dead layer and surface contaminants. Most of these processes [33\u201336,38,39], commonly known as \u2018emitter etch-back\u2019, are based on additional surface cleans as they typically provide a shallow etch-back of the anomalously doped ILDE surface region. Recently Basu et al. [30,32] reported a new non-acidic etch-back solution (the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019), which enables a deep etch-back without impacting emitter uniformity or surface reflectivity. During this etch-back of emitter surface by the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 solution for the ILD double-textured Si wafers, the damaged Si layer arising from the RIE nano-texturing process had also been simultaneously removed. This way in our proposed process flow (presented here) there was no need of any additional DRE process as mentioned earlier in Section 1. 2.2 Characterisation Variations in surface morphology were tracked using SEM (Carl Zeiss, Auriga) after selected processing stages: micro texturing (acidic/alkaline), double-texturing, inline diffusion, and after etch back. In regards to doping properties, a four-point probe mapping tester (Cresbox, NAPSON) was used to map the R sq uniformity. The effective minority carrier lifetime (\u03c4 eff), implied open-circuit voltage (V oc) and emitter saturation current density (J 0e) were measured using a lifetime tester (Sinton Instruments, WCT-120). Using a UV\u2013vis-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 950), the AM1.5G WAR values in the 300\u20131000nm wavelength range were measured after texturing, DRE/etch-back, and ARC SiNx deposition. 3 Results and discussion Wafers from the same ingot with a narrow base resistivity range (1.1\u20131.2\u03a9cm) were selected to minimise the impact of variation in the bulk lifetime (of the multi-Si wafers) on the effective minority carrier lifetime. As all the wafers underwent an identical processing sequence (except for RIE texturing), it can be assumed that variations of \u03c4 eff are indicative of the impact of the texturing process on effective lifetime. After selection, all wafers (108 wafers) were acidic-textured (as per Section 2.1.1) with simultaneous etching of \u223c2.6\u03bcm Si from each side. The wafers were then divided into nine groups (G-1\u2013G-9), each containing 12 wafers. The first eight groups (G-1\u2013G-8) were RIE-textured (both sides) using a range of process conditions as listed in Table 1 . As the process uniformity of the used plasma chamber was limited to its central area, only four wafers were processed simultaneously. The last group (G-9) was used as a reference group for lifetime analysis and was therefore not RIE-textured. In order to assure a uniform deposition, the chamber pressure and gas flow ratio were fixed at 200mTorr and 2:1, respectively, based on the optimisation results of tool parameters not detailed here. Plasma power and etching time were then varied to create various uniform nano-surface structures (needle-like). Table 1 clearly indicates that higher plasma power and longer etching duration resulted in a higher Si etching rate. A combination of low power and large etching duration reduces the etching rate (see G-6), however, it also improves uniformity. One representative wafer from the double-textured wafer groups (G-1\u2013G-8) and micro-textured wafer group (G-9) was chosen for SEM inspection. Fig. 2 presents the variation of surface morphology among all the wafer groups. The rougher and spikier surfaces observed in Images 2(A) and (B) correlate to the combination of highest plasma power and larger etching duration. By reducing the etching duration, the spiky nature of the Si surface was moderated (Fig. 2(C) and (D)). At the lower etching duration (8min), spikes were largely confined to the elevated regions (i.e., at the grain boundaries) of the starting acidic textured surface (see Fig. 2(E)). Fig. 2(F)\u2013(H) show the images of the surfaces etched at lower power and shorter etching duration. A periodic combination of nano-holes and smaller spikes is observed in Fig. 2(F), extending uniformly over the starting isotropic textured surface (as shown in Fig. 2(I)). However, this uniformity decreased with reducing etching duration (compare Fig. 2(G) and (H)) as the nano-holes progressively disappear. As we want to retain the nano-holes for enhanced anti-reflection, and completely etch the nano-spikes in the following DRE/etch-back process to negate the detrimental effects of the nano-spikes, a suitable combination of nano-holes and nano-spikes is required for a good double-texturing process. On this basis, the process conditions of group G-6 (Fig. 2(F)) were judged to be the most suitable ones for double-texturing. As mentioned, the surface reflectance of all wafers (96 double-textured and 12 micro-textured) was measured and their WAR values were recorded. After using one wafer from each group for an SEM inspection, the remaining wafers (11 each from G-1 to G-9) were used as lifetime samples and underwent processes as described in Section 2.1.3. Two wafers from each group were separated randomly for additional SEM measurements; one after inline diffusion and the second after DRE/etch-back. Table 2 summarises the average (ave) and standard deviation (std dev) values of WAR, \u03c4 eff, implied V oc and J 0e of the different groups, while Fig. 3 presents the variation of WAR (with and without ARC SiNx) across the different groups. Both Table 2 and Fig. 3 indicate that the average WARs of all the double-textured groups are well below 5%. Fig. 4 presents the variation of \u03c4 eff and J 0e of each group. Symmetrical lifetime structure was used, although this structure will not be employed in the solar cell structure, since it has been shown to provide the optimum sensitivity of the measured \u03c4 eff regarding variation of surface recombination [40,41]. In this study, \u03c4 eff is reported at excess carrier concentration of 1015 cm\u22123, while J 0e is extracted at excess carrier concentration of 1016 cm\u22123 using the method suggested by Kane-Swanson [42]. Note that as symmetrical structure was used, J 0e of a single surface can easily be calculated (as it is assumed both surfaces are identical). Therefore, the calculated J 0e characterises the actual solar cell's emitter fabricated using the proposed process. This is to be noted that in the actual solar cell structure double-texturing process needs to be performed only on the emitter side. However, the values of WAR, \u03c4, iV oc and J 0e will still be expected to be of the same values as for their both side textured samples. It can be clearly seen that, among wafers from the same group the deviation from the average values is within a small 3\u20136% range, demonstrating a good uniformity for both acidic-texturing and RIE-texturing processes. The strong etching in G-1 and G-2 groups and long spikes, especially on the grain boundaries (see Fig. 3(A) and (B)), resulted in higher surface roughness hypothesised to be the reason of comparatively low \u03c4 eff and high J 0e values. The rest of the groups (G-3\u2013G-8) obtain similar \u03c4 eff (28\u201335\u03bcs) and J 0e (0.3\u20130.5pA/cm2) values compared to the ones obtained by the micro-textured reference group (\u03c4 eff =32\u03bcs and J 0e =0.4pA/cm2). However, the G-6 and G-8 group wafers provide the highest \u03c4 eff and lowest J 0e among all the groups. By considering the results of the SEM inspection and the measured WAR, \u03c4 eff, implied V oc and J 0e, wafers from the G-6 and G-8 groups were evaluated as the best double-textured processes. Between the two, the G-6 process was preferred as it assumed that the improved J sc (due to the lower WAR), would overcome the slightly lower voltage (due to lower lifetime) in the completed device. The SEM images of representative wafers from the reference micro-textured G-9 group, after the inline diffusion and emitter etch-back steps, are shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5(A) shows the unwanted deposition of surface contaminants on the micro-textured surface. Horzel et al. [33] proposed that these structures are formed during rapid cooling of the dopant solution (H3PO4 and solvent) with a formation of silicon phosphide (SiP) precipitates and it involves very high phosphorus (P) concentrations above the solid solubility limit of P in Si. In order to remove potential contamination from the metallic conveyor belt, and also to etch off this heavily doped dead layer along with the SiP precipitates, stripping of this top layer is necessary. Recently Basu et al. [30,32] reported a new non-acidic etch-back solution (the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019), which enables a deep etch-back without impacting emitter uniformity or surface reflectivity. This solution was applied in the present study on acidic-textured inline-diffused multi-Si wafers, where the as-diffused \u223c40\u03a9/sq emitter was etched to R sq of \u223c70\u03a9/sq. Fig. 5(B) presents a representative SEM image of the surface after emitter etch-back; no visible surface impurities exist and no modification of the surface morphology is observed even after this deep etch-back. The surface condition of a representative as-diffused double-textured wafer (after inline diffusion) from G-6 group is presented in the SEM image of Fig. 6(A). A heavy deposition of surface contaminants is clearly visible. The rough surface of the double-textured wafer accumulates a large concentration of surface debris arising from the inline diffusion. However, as evident in Fig. 6(B), after 60s of the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 treatment, all these surface contaminants were removed. It should also be noted that nano-spikes, which were earlier present in its pre-diffused condition and generated during nano-texturing by RIE (see Fig. 2(F)), were no longer present. Also the underlying micro-textured surface remains clearly distinct on the DRE/etch-back wafer. The magnified image shown in Fig. 6(C) further confirms that the formation of the desired double-textured SWS surface sculpted with nano-holes combined with the underlying micro-structured multi-Si surface. Consequently, this novel process eliminates the requirement of pre-diffusion DRE needed for effective removal of RIE induced damages in the form of nano-spikes. Elimination of the degrading effects of the RIE by using the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 is also confirmed by the lifetime results. It also confirms the effective removal of SiP precipitates and dead layer by the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 even on this very rough double-textured inline-diffused emitter surface. Reflectance graphs of the pre-diffused and post-diffused double and micro (acidic)-textured multi-Si wafers are shown in Fig. 7 . After double-texturing the reflectance of the surface is significantly reduced across the entire measured wavelength range, compared to the reference acidic-textured wafers (see curves 7(A) and (C)). After SiNx ARC deposition, this reduction is more pronounced for wavelengths below 550nm and above 750nm (see curves 7(B) and (D)), as reported previously by other researchers [13,28,29]. A viable emitter etch-back process requires a uniform Si etching irrespective of the surface texture. This requirement has previously been confirmed by the application of the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 on standard alkaline-textured wafers [32]. However, for the inline-diffused double-textured wafers with their altered surface morphology, emitter uniformity must be maintained for efficient solar cell fabrication using this novel DRE/etch-back process. To analyse this, emitter sheet resistance uniformity was measured before and after the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 treatment for the double-textured wafers. The R sq of representative wafers were mapped as-diffused (after PSG removal) and after simultaneous DRE/etch-back by the \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 (see Fig. 8 ). The std dev of R sq across the wafers increased from 0.4\u03a9/sq (before DRE/etch-back) to 2.1\u03a9/sq (after DRE/etch-back). This increase is within usable value for its application of the emitter and comparable to previous results for standard wet-chemically textured wafers [32]. It thereby confirms the R sq uniformity of the \u2018SERIS\u2019 etch-back process on this novel double-textured multi-Si surface. Moreover, the process additionally serves as a simultaneous DRE process during the same 60s of process duration. The existing fabrication process for RIE etched multi-Si cells involves four major steps before ARC deposition and final metallisation. It includes conventional acidic texturing, RIE texturing, DRE and finally tube diffusion [12]. However, in our presented process here low-cost inline diffusion replaces costly tube diffusion. The above process combination is now replaced by the conventional acidic texturing, RIE texturing, inline diffusion and finally DRE/etch-back and thus can still generate some cost advantage. With an added advantage of front reflectance reduction (by \u223c3% absolute) this modified process sequence has the potential to increase cell efficiency by up to \u223c3% of the efficiency of the conventional acid textured cell. The increase in cell efficiency and the use of low cost inline diffusion furnace (in place of a conventional costly tube diffusion one) show a strong possibility to get back the additional cost involved in the RIE tool. However, it all depends on the production volume of the cell fabrication plant. The double-textured process was also tested on monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si wafers), using the same optimised RIE conditions. The double-textured (in this case alkaline-texturing and RIE-texturing) and reference alkaline-textured wafers were inline diffused (R sq \u223c40\u03a9/sq), followed by emitter etch-back to R sq of \u223c70\u03a9/sq. The SEM images of these wafers are shown in Fig. 9 . The debris concentration was, as expected, higher on the double-textured wafer (see Fig. 9(A) and (C)). As mentioned, this accumulation was higher on double-textured surfaces due to rougher surface arising from the nano-spikes. However, as observed in Fig. 9(B) and (D), these contaminants were completely removed after 160s of etch-back. The final double-textured emitter surface maintains an excellent pyramidal surface with superimposed nano-holes. Reflectance graphs of the pre-diffused and post-diffused double and alkaline-textured mono-Si wafers are shown in Fig. 10 . Similar to multi-Si wafers, an improvement can be observed in the entire measurement range for the double-textured pre-diffused wafers (see Fig. 10(A)) as compared to its alkaline-textured counterpart (see Fig. 10(C)). For the final emitter after ARC deposition, this enhancement was found to be restricted to both the short wavelength and long wavelength range of the spectrum for the double-textured wafer (see in Fig. 10(B)). Compared to an acidic-textured multi-Si wafer (WAR \u223c26.9%, see Fig. 7(C)), the alkaline-textured mono-Si wafer already had a relatively low WAR value (11.7%, see Fig. 10(C)), limiting the scope for further improvements in the WAR. The contribution of nano-texturing on the pyramidal mono-Si surface provided only a small WAR reduction (by \u223c0.5%, compare Fig. 10(B) and (D)) after ARC. This demonstrates the domination of micro-texturing on the optical properties on mono-Si wafers. Moreover, the observed smaller depth of the nano-holes on the mono-Si wafer (see Fig. 10(D)) as compared to multi-Si wafers (see Fig. 7(B)) may be another reason for the lower benefit of nano-texturing for mono-Si wafers. We have applied here the optimised nano-texturing process condition developed for multi-Si wafers and it seems to provide limited overall improvement for mono-Si wafers. Nevertheless, a gain in the blue and long-wavelength ranges (below 350nm and above 600nm) is clearly evident (compare Fig. 10(B) and (D)). 4 Conclusion A novel non-metallic approach for the fabrication of double-textured emitter surfaces of multicrystalline silicon wafers has been reported. The proposed double-texturing process includes micro-texturing by a conventional isotropic acidic-texturing (for multi-Si) process and nano-texturing by a RIE process. The proposed process applies low-cost inline diffusion for p\u2013n junction formation and uses a non-acidic emitter etch-back process to etch defects associated with RIE texturing. Optimisation of the double-textured surface was achieved by tuning the RIE nano-texturing on the initial micro-textured Si surface, followed by an etch-back process to maximise the effective carrier lifetime. The effective lifetime of the double-textured wafers was found to be similar to that of the conventional acidic-textured reference group, while the solar WAR was significantly lower (3.2% compared to 6.1% after SiNx ARC deposition). Hence, the applications of metal-free etching process, simultaneous DRE/emitter etch-back, and uniform emitter have been achieved without losing the lower WAR advantage of the SWS structure. As reported previously by other researchers, a significant reduction of the surface reflectance for both short and long wavelengths is also clearly observed for this novel SWS structure. The WAR and effective carrier lifetime results indicate that this novel process is a viable candidate for the fabrication of high-efficiency multi-Si wafer solar cells. The process was also successfully applied to mono-Si wafers to generate double-textured SWS structures.

Double-texturing, including a micro-texturing by conventional isotropic acidic-texturing followed by nano-texturing using sub-wavelength structures (SWS), provides a possibility to remove this limitation. However, presently available double-texturing processes involve multiple and high-cost nano-texturing process steps and thus have not become industrially viable. This study presents an improved double-texturing process and reports its successful implementation using low-cost inline-diffusion and non-acidic \u2018SERIS etch\u2019 etch-back technology. The process is based on reactive ion etching (RIE) as a metal-free nano-texturing step, along with the conventional acidic iso-texturing process. The process is optimised based on effective minority carrier lifetime and weighted average reflectance (WAR) measurements, on 156\u00d7156mm2, industrial-grade, p-type multi-Si wafers. This optimised double-textured SWS surface has a WAR of 3.2% after silicon nitride deposition, which is significantly lower than that of conventional acidic iso-textured wafers (WAR of 6\u20137%). However, this optimised surface maintains the same values of the effective minority carrier lifetime as for the reference conventional acidic-textured multi-Si wafers. The optimised nano-texturing recipe is also successfully applied to alkaline-textured monocrystalline silicon wafers.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2014-07-15", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169433214008666", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Basu, Prabir Kanti"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chakraborty, Sandipan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hameiri, Ziv"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Boreland, Matthew Benjamin"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169433214008666"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433214008666"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0169-4332(14)00866-6", "prism:volume": "307", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Novel non-metallic non-acidic approach to generate sub-wavelength surface structures for inline-diffused multicrystalline silicon wafer solar cells", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.
