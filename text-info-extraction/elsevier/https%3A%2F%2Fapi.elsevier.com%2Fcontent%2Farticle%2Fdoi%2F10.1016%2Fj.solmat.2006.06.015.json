Low-cost, large area, random and mask less texturing scheme independent of crystal orientation are some of the factors that significantly influence the success of terrestrial photovoltaic technology. This work is focused on the texturing of the silicon surface microstructures by reactive ion etching using a multi-hollow cathode system. Desirable texturing effect has been achieved by applying a radio-frequency power of about 20W per hollow cathode glow. The etched silicon surface shows almost zero reflectance in the visible region as well as in near-IR region. The silicon surface is covered by columnar microstructures with diameters ranging from 50 to 100nm and with a depth of about 500nm. Solar cells with efficiencies of 11.7% and 10.2% with black mono-crystalline and multi-crystalline silicon wafers, respectively, were successfully fabricated and tested. Keywords Reactive ion etching Hollow cathode Reflectance Solar cell 1 Introduction Surface texturization is usually performed to enhance light absorption in silicon solar cells [1]. Wet anisotropic chemical etching technique used to form random pyramidal structure on \u3008100\u3009 silicon wafers is not very effective in texturing multi-crystalline silicon wafers because of the randomly orientated crystallites. The quality of low-cost multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell performance is close to that of mono-crystalline (c-Si) solar cell, with the major difference resulting from the inability to texture mc-Si surface. Expensive anti-reflection layers like silicon nitride and magnesium fluoride have been applied to the front surface of mc-Si solar cell to reduce light reflection. Recently, various forms of texturing been tried on mc-Si surface including, laser structuring [2], mechanical diamond saw cutting [3], porous-Si etching [4\u20137], photo-lithographically defined etching [8], and reactive ion etching (RIE) [9]. Historical review for RIE texturing of silicon can be found in Sandia report (Zaidi, SAND2000-0919, Sandia contract \u266fBE-8229, April 2000). From that review, it is evident that different gas mixtures can be used for the creation of black silicon, which is a grass-like structure that occurs at the bottom of deep trenches on the surface of silicon. Jansen et al. [10] reported the preparation of black silicon using planar parallel plate (Plasmafab 340, Plasmatherm 500) and hexode (AME-8100) reactors with SF6/CHF3/O2 plasma. In SF6/O2 plasma, SF6 is the source of active fluorine that etches silicon and the oxygen radicals passivate the surface of the etched silicon surface. An extensive study of the SF6/O2 RIE for silicon solar cell application was done by Ruby et al. [11] using a parallel-plate reactor. They observed different shapes of etched microstructures over the silicon surface which was covered with a thin passivating siliconoxyfluoride layer. The origin of the micro-masks on the top of the etched silicon structures might be from the silicon surface contaminations. Microstructures with nearly vertical walls were obtained on keeping a certain balance between the etching and the passivation. This special technique, a metal\u2013catalyst approach for the sputtering of metal contaminations, had received a patent support [12]. Finding other types of reactors to produce black silicon surface is quite interesting. In this work, we investigated the possibility of obtaining a black silicon surface using a radio frequency (RF) multi-hollow cathode discharge system. Due to the low-operating voltages, RF multi-hollow cathode system produces lesser plasma-induced damages to silicon surface than that of the conventional RF diode plasma systems. For the present study we used a multi-electrode embodiment RF multi-hollow cathode system, which adapts to a high-production environment. In this paper, we report the formation of uniform black silicon surface on both c-Si and mc-Si wafers using the above-mentioned system. We also report the fabrication of black c-Si and mc-Si solar cells using conventional POCl3 diffusion. 2 Experimental 2.1 RF multi-hollow cathode reactor The schematic block diagram of the RF multi-hollow cathode reactor used in the present experiment is shown in Fig. 1 . This reactor consists of a Pyrex tube defining the vacuum chamber, with a outer metal cylindrical electrode (grounded) acting as a counter electrode for powered aluminum plate electrodes assembly which is in electrical contact with silicon wafers. The plate electrodes have a diameter of 150mm each. These electrodes are electrically and structurally connected by metal supports close to their outer rim with a separation space of 25mm between each of them. The Pyrex tube has an inner diameter of 190mm. The RF power creates an electrical field on electrode surface and causes an excitation of reactive gases in the space between the electrodes, preferably between the silicon wafers. This produces a high level of ionization of the gas and dense plasma therein due to the repelling movement of the entrapped electrons between the powered electrodes; and this is called the hollow cathode effect [13]. Uniform deposition of micro-masks over the silicon surface is a necessary condition for uniform texturing. The origin of micro-masks in the present case may be from the re-sputtering of both the aluminum electrodes and the Pyrex tube. 2.2 Black silicon etching Initially, we have taken as-cut c-Si wafers with specifications of 1\u20135\u03a9cm, \u3008100\u3009, p-type, 350\u03bcm thick and 103 \u00d7103mm dimensions and as-cut mc-Si wafers with specifications of 1\u20135\u03a9cm, p-type, 275\u03bcm thick and 100\u00d7100mm dimensions. Before starting the surface etching, c-Si wafers were texturized by conventional wet texturing technique and chemically polished the mc-Si wafers by 21HNO3:7HF:16CH3COOH mixture, respectively. Textured c-Si and polished mc-Si wafers were mounted on the aluminum electrodes inside the multi-hollow cathode plasma reactor. Plasma etching was performed using SF6/O2 mixtures to produce a randomly textured silicon surfaces that look black because of near-zero surface reflection. The silicon surface is found to be covered by a lot of columnar microstructures which are responsible for the zero reflection. Desirable texturing is achieved when the RF power (13.56MHz frequency) of about 20W per one hollow cathode glow is applied in the multi-hollow cathode reactor. SF6/O2 partial pressure ratio was maintained at 2.5 with the etching pressure of 50mTorr. The texturization was performed for 20min. The black silicon surface reflection was characterized in the visible to IR spectral region using a UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer (model no. SCINCO S-2100). 2.3 Black silicon solar cell fabrication Conventional POCl3 diffusion and screen-printed metallization were employed to fabricate solar cells using black surface silicon wafers. The block diagram showing the sequence of steps followed during the solar cell fabrication is given in Fig. 2 . The black silicon wafers were diffused by n-type impurity in an open-tube furnace using conventional POCl3 diffusion source at 860\u00b0C with a 20min pre-deposition followed by a 40min drive-in. Phosphosilicate glass (PSG)-removed and POCl3-diffused silicon wafers were passivated with a thin oxide layer (\u2a7d10nm) at a temperature of 750\u00b0C. After edge isolation, the front and back metallization of the diffused black silicon wafers were carried out using standard Al-paste (product no. FX 53-038, Ferro Electronic Materials) and Ag-paste (product no. 3349, Ferro Electronic Materials). The metallization was done by screen-printing technique and this was followed by baking and co-firing at a temperature of 740\u00b0C in a conveyer belt furnace. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 3 shows a typical normal incidence spectral reflectance of black mc-Si surface. The reflectance of the polished silicon is also plotted for comparison. The surface of the etched silicon shows almost zero reflection in the visible as well as in the near-IR regions. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigation was done on these randomly etched black silicon surfaces. The SEM micrographs of the c-Si and mc-Si etched surfaces are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) , respectively. From these micrographs, it is seen that silicon surfaces are covered with a lot of columnar microstructures. The columnar microstructures have diameters ranging from 50 to 100nm each with a depth of about 500nm. The sidewall passivation of etched columns with siliconoxyfluoride film is very sensitive to oxygen content at the silicon surface. Any deficiency of oxygen is the main cause for the change of black surface into a polished one. Moreover, in the hollow cathode system of the present study, the RF discharge allows an improvement of plasma density by an order of magnitude in comparison to a standard RF parallel-plate discharge. The increase in the plasma density has been achieved with the hollow cathode configuration, and it is attributed to the so called \u2018electron mirror\u2019 effect in which a negative self-developed bias voltage on the two opposing RF powered electrodes helps to increase the density of the high-energy electrons (responsible for ionization) and to reduce their recombination rate. Moreover, the hollow cathode effect can be enhanced by (i) confining the discharge at an appropriate level, that results in raising plasma density, (ii) increasing flow of ions to the electrodes (substrates) and (iii) decreasing the average energy of the ions. The electrons have much higher mobility than the ions, and they are very easily collected on to electrode whenever it becomes positive with respect to the glow space. This fact in turn, causes depletion of electrons from the dark space with consequent rise in potential of the glow space with respect to the electrodes. The surface of the RF-powered hollow cathode electrode has acquired a self-bias which will have a value equal to nearly half of the applied RF peak-to-peak voltage. The voltage at the electrode surface is positive for a very short fraction of each cycle and hence the ion bombardment is almost continuous. The energy of the majority of the ions centers about the bias voltage across the dark space at the substrate and the ions will undergo several oscillations on their way across the sheath at a high frequency (>4MHz). The electrons originated at the hollow cathode surface traversed the inter electrode space to the opposite surface of the hollow cathode. The surface electrical field serves as a mirror so that the electrons are forced to move towards the glow space plasma region from both sides. This electrode configuration leads to the oscillation of electrons; it also leads to an increase in the number of ionization events per electron when compared with a conventional parallel-plate RF plasma discharge. The RF hollow cathode discharge is characterized by the low-voltage and high current density regimes. The lower voltage means more ion flux (current) leading to higher etch rate in comparison to the conventional RF discharge at the same power. Fig. 5 shows the photographs of large area black c-Si and mc-Si solar cells fabricated in our laboratory. The dimensions of c-Si and mc-Si are 103mm\u00d7103mm and 100mm\u00d7100mm, respectively. The performance of the solar cells were measured under the standard 100mW/cm2 AM1.5 (air mass) global spectrum at 25\u00b0C and Table 1 lists the measured parameters of the solar cells. Fig. 6 shows the light-illuminated current\u2013voltage (LIV) characteristics of the solar cells. This figure shows the low open-circuit voltage of both c-Si as well as mc-Si solar cells. Moreover, from the dark current\u2013voltage characteristics of the cells as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b) , it is observed that the recombination current components (I 02) of dark current (consist of injection current components I 01 and recombination current component I 02) for both c-Si and mc-Si solar cells are very small indicating the formation of a shunt path across the junction of the fabricated solar cells. The low values of shunt resistance and hence the leakage across the junction leads to low values of open-circuit voltages. These factors show that the RF multi-hollow cathode plasma system used in this study has the capability to produce uniform black surface silicon wafers for the fabrication of solar cells that are compatible with the rest of the silicon solar cells. 4 Conclusion RIE on both c-Si and mc-Si samples has been performed using RF multi-hollow cathode plasma system. Plasma texturing has been shown to produce black silicon surfaces with almost zero reflectance. The silicon surface was covered with columnar microstructures each having diameter ranging from 50 to 100nm and depth of about 500nm. Solar cells with efficiencies 11.7% and 10.2% were fabricated using black c-Si and black mc-Si wafers, respectively, by making use of industrial mass production line system. Further improvement in black silicon solar cell performance can be expected using proper optimization of the cell fabrication process parameters. References [1] P. Campbell M.A. Green J. Appl.
