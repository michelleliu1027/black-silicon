College of Materials Science and Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Materials and Technology for Energy Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Nanjing 210016 PR China Silicon solar cells have been center of focus over the decades while the price challenge still hinders its large-scale application. Cost reduction is the urgent pursuit and our work focuses on the texturization process for mono-crystalline silicon. In this report, nanostructures made by metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) method were introduced before texturization in low-concentration alkaline solution, which shows the advantage in controlling uniformity and thickness losses compared with standard-concentration alkaline solution. By varying MACE etching time, black silicon layers with different morphologies and depths were obtained. Consequently, pyramid structures of different sizes were observed after texturizaiton. Minimum reflectance value of 10.3% and mean pyramid size of 2.95\u202f\u00b5m were achieved in low-concentration alkaline solution with optimized MACE etching time. By using SEM, PL and analytical balance to analyze the morphologies of black silicon samples and corresponding thickness losses, we speculated that the nanostructures of black silicon layers acted as the preferential sites for etching, thus accelerated the texturization process and completed within only 10\u202fmin. In summary, low-concentration, short-time and less silicon consumption texturization for mono-crystalline silicon could be achieved using our one-step MACE-induced method, exhibiting great potential in commercial photovoltaics utilization and ultra-thin silicon solar cells. Keywords Metal-assisted chemical etching Fast texturization Low-concentration alkaline solution Ultra-thin silicon solar cells 1 Introduction Over the past decades, solar energy has gained tremendous interest due to its abundance, sustainability, requires low processing temperature and as matter of fact, yields no harmful byproducts compared to fossil energy. Owing to China and India led rapid deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV), it will become the largest source of low-carbon capacity by 2040, by which time the share of all renewables in total power generation reaches 40% [1]. Due to the cost advantage and stability in the long run, silicon-based solar cells, including mono-crystalline silicon and poly-crystalline silicon solar cells, is dominating the commercial PV market [2,3]. Tremendous progress has been made in silicon-based solar cells, and record of conversion efficiency of 26.6% was achieved in 2017 [4]. However, silicon solar cells still meet the price challenge, hindering its further development for commercial application. Therefore, cost reduction is an outstanding focus for photovoltaics industry, in which the texturization process is one of the keynotes. According to literature, Crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers cannot absorb the light effectively because of the relatively low absorption coefficient of c-Si [5], putting the spot light on the significance of the advanced light-trapping texture. Aimed to successfully reduce the optical reflectance, many wet-chemical systems, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) based solutions [6\u20139], tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) [10,11], tribasic sodium phosphate (Na3PO4\u00b712H2O) [12,13], sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) [14,15], sodium carbonate/bicarbonate (Na2CO3/NaHCO3) [16,17], hydrofluoric acid/ hydrochloric acid /hydrogen peroxide (HF/HCl/H2O2) [18], hydrazine mono-hydrate (N2H4\u00b7H2O) [19] and hydrofluoric acid/ferric chloride (HF/FeCl3) [20], were explored to prepare light-trapping structure on the silicon surface. Among these systems, NaOH/KOH based solution has been widely utilized for mono-crystalline silicon texturization in industry, not only for its superior anti-reflection (AR) effect but also the cost saving with respect to mass production [21]. In previous reports, NaOH/KOH concentration was mainly chosen 2\u202fwt%, temperature was set to 80\u202f\u00b0C, and the texturization process usually lasted for 25\u201335\u202fmin [18,22,23]. In the NaOH/KOH system, isopropanol (IPA) was employed as an additive [6]. In addition, it was reported that silicon wafers account for 61% of the price of today's silicon solar cells [24], hence the thickness of wafers was supposed to be reduced. Ultra-thin silicon solar cell has been a hot topic due to less silicon consumption, lightweight and flexibility [5,25]. Meanwhile, considering the poor light-harvesting ability, ultra-thin silicon solar cells should be more sensitive to thickness variation, indicating that the thickness losses during the fabrication process should be strictly controlled. In brief, a low-cost, short-time, less silicon consumption method is required, not only for current photovoltaics industry, but also for the ultra-thin silicon solar cells in the future. In this work, NaOH is chosen as alkali source and IPA concentration is set to 5\u202fvol%. First, the difference of silicon textured in low-concentration (1.0\u202fwt% NaOH) and standard-concentration alkaline solution (2.0\u202fwt% NaOH) is compared and the low-concentration case is found to have benefits in controlling uniformity of microstructures. Within low-concentration alkaline solution, a one-step metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) process is introduced to compensate its shortage on etching rates. By varying the MACE etching time, the effects of MACE etching time on texturization are explored. Moreover, a mechanism is proposed to explain the outcomes. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Pre-treatment Mono-crystalline p-type Si (100) wafers (thickness 180\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b5m, resistivity 1\u20133\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm) were polished on both sides within 25\u202fwt% NaOH solution at 78\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C for 450\u202fs. The polished wafers were cut into 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm2 squares and immersed into 10% aqueous HF to remove surface oxide layer after washed using standard RCA clean process, which consisting of RCA1(NH3\u00b7H2O: H2O2: H2O=1:1:5) solution and RCA2(HCl: H2O2: H2O=1:1:5) solution for 5\u202fmin at 60\u202f\u00b0C. The deionized water (DIW) was used to clear HF residual. 2.2 MACE process Next, the wafers were immersed into a mixture solution containing 4\u202fM HF, 0.6\u202fM H2O2, 0.6\u202fmM AgNO3 and DIW. Black silicon (BS) with different depths and porosities were prepared with one-step MACE method by varying the etching time from 0\u202fs to 90\u202fs with the step of 30\u202fs. The prepared BS samples were named as BS-0, BS-30, BS-60 and BS-90 for the different MACE etching time. Afterwards the BS samples were rinsed into solution (NH3\u00b7H2O: H2O2 =1:1) to remove Ag residual followed by cleaning process with DIW, HF and DIW successively. 2.3 Texturization process The as-prepared BS samples were dipped into low-concentration alkaline solution, including 1.0\u202fwt% NaOH, 5\u202fvol% IPA and DIW, and the texturing process last for 10\u202fmin at 78\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C. Subsequently, the textured wafers were washed with DIW, HF and DIW successively. The textured samples were named as T-0, T-30, T-60 and T-90, respectively. As a comparison, a piece of polished silicon wafer was put in standard solution (2.0\u202fwt% NaOH, 5\u202fvol% IPA and DIW) at 78\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin and the textured sample was named as T-B. 2.4 Characterization The morphologies of as-prepared samples were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI, Quanta 650) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL, PTI, QM40-NIR). The surface reflectance of textured samples was acquired through the ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600, with an integrating sphere). The analytical balance was used in mass difference method for calculating the reduced thickness. 3 Results and discussion SEM images of the polished silicon wafer textured in low-concentration and standard-concentration alkaline solution at 78\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin are shown in Fig. 1(a, b, d, e). As exhibited in Fig. 1(a, b), plenty of small-size pyramid structures fully covered the silicon surface of T-0. The sizes of microstructures mainly distributed in the range of 0.5\u20132\u202f\u00b5m with a mean value of 1.48\u202f\u00b5m (Fig. 1(c)). The standard deviation (SD) was a parameter which quantified the dispersion of a set of data. With respect to sample T-B in Fig. 1(d, e), the silicon surface was partially overlapped by larger pyramid-like structures and blank regions were clearly observed, showing poor uniformity. Statistical results in Fig. 1(f) revealed that the sizes of pyramid structure distributed among 0\u201318\u202f\u00b5m and mean value was 7.18\u202f\u00b5m. Obviously, silicon wafers were unable to be textured completely in standard-concentration alkaline solution within 10\u202fmin. As a comparison, microstructures in Fig. 1(a, b) presented better uniformity and higher surface coverage rate. The underline principle is based on the electrochemical reaction between Si and H2O/OH- redox couple. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the electron affinity and work function of silicon are estimated to 4.05 eV and 4.98 eV, respectively. On the side of electrolyte, the main reactants are H2O molecules and OH- ions. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is a redox electrode which forms the basis of the thermodynamic scale of oxidation-reduction potential. Its absolute electrode potential is estimated to \u22124.44 \u00b1 0.02 V at 25 \u00b0C compared to vacuum level and the potential shifts towards more positive values by 0.0591 mV/PH [26]. In this 1.0 wt% NaOH electrolyte, the PH value was approximately 12.1. Therefore, the electrode potential was determined to 3.7 V with respect to vacuum level [9]. After immersion into the electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the Fermi levels on both sides of Si/electrolyte interface would be brought to the same level by electrons transferring from electrolyte to silicon, leading to the downward bending of the silicon conduction band and valence band. Due to the special bonding sites of surface silicon atoms, the surface states, including dangling bond A and backbonds B\u2032 (for Si (111) atoms) and B\u2033 (for Si (100) atoms), appeared and located in the forbidden band. The reaction between Si atoms and NaOH could be depicted as followed equation: [27] (1) Anode: Si + 6 OH \u2212 \u2192 Si O 3 2 \u2212 + 3 H 2 O + 4 e \u2212 E 0 = 1.697 V (2) Cathode : 2 H 2 O + 2 e \u2212 \u2192 2 OH \u2212 + H 2 \u2191 E 0 = \u2212 0.8277 V The whole reaction: (3) Si + 2 OH \u2212 + H 2 O \u2192 Si O 3 2 \u2212 + 2 H 2 \u2191 \u0394 E = 0.0416 V In which E0 is the standard electrode potential and \u0394E means the electrode potential of the whole reaction. It could be observed in Fig. 2 and Eqs. (1)\u2013(3), the electrons, which were used for the reduction of H2, came from dangling bond A and conduction band. At the same time, the holes, which were used for the oxidation of Si atoms, were injected into the silicon backbonds from electrolyte. Owing to the energy difference between B\u2032 and B\u2033, holes were selectively injected into the backbonds, resulting in different etching rates between Si (100) and Si (111) plane, hence the anisotropic etching ascended and pyramid structure formed. The reaction rate of Eq. (3) could be characterized by the equation: (4) r = r 0 [ O H \u2212 ] 2 where r indicates the reaction rate, and r0 is the rate constant and [OH-] stands by the concentration of OH- ions. Based on Eq. (4), the reaction rate is strongly dependent on the concentration of OH- ions. That explained the morphology difference between Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(d). At the beginning of texturization, some regions on the silicon surface were prior to being etched, acting as the preferential sites of nucleation, and kept growing up with time going on. Regarding low-concentration alkaline solution, the growth rates were relatively slow and other nucleation sites gradually emerged, eventually, fully covering the silicon surface by the small-size pyramid structure. However, reaction rate was rapidly increased when standard-concentration alkaline solution was employed. Those preferential sites grew faster and nucleation of other areas seemed to be suppressed, in consequence, larger microstructures and blank areas were observed simultaneously. Low-concentration alkaline solution is exhibiting its advantage in controlling uniformity while the etching rate is relatively slow due to the depressing effect on anode reaction. In order to shorten the texturization time, we proposed to accelerate the cathode reaction by introducing an MACE process before texturization, causing larger specific surface area along with more dangling bonds. As mentioned above, the electrons came from dangling bond A and conduction band with respect to cathode reaction, indicating that more dangling bonds could be effective in accelerating etching process. One-step MACE procedure was employed and vertically aligned nanostructures with different depths and morphologies were prepared by varying the MACE etching time from 30 s to 90 s. With incremental etching time, the pores density on the silicon surface performed a rising tendency. Comparing the cross section SEM images in Fig. 3(d, e, f), the pores depths, which were defined as d, increased with the MACE etching time, ranging from 110 nm to 540 nm. An interesting phenonmenon was observed that the porous layer in Fig. 3(f) could be devided into two parts based on different porosity, including high-porosity BS top layer and low-porosity BS bottom layer. Moreover, collapsion of the pores on the surface of the top layer was observed, which could be due to excessive etching. In order to further confirm the porosity variation on silicon surface under different MACE etching time, PL measurement was done on all BS samples and results are shown in Fig. 4. The intensity of PL spectra shows an increasing trend with incremental MACE etching time, which could be ascribed to the increase in depths of porous layers. Since all PL spectra of BS samples showed a certain width as well as near positions for peaks, there should be a size distribution of nanostructures. For all the fitted PL spectra in Fig. 4(b, c, d), three peaks (main peak, peak-\u03b1 and peak-\u03b2) were observed, inferring the presence of three types of nanostructures, such as normal-size vertical nanopores, small-size nanopits and shallow transverse grooves. Compared to main peak, peak-\u03b1 and peak-\u03b2 exhibited much weaker intensity, indicating the ascendancy of main peak. Detailed information was listed in Table 1, in which the main peaks were located at 559.19 nm, 568.28 nm and 567.19 nm, corresponding to different MACE etching time of 30, 60 and 90 s, respectively. Compared to BS-60, the main peak of BS-90 was blue shifted to 567.19 nm owing to collapsion of the pores on the surface of the top porous layer. After MACE process, BS samples were textured in low-concentration alkaline solution at 78 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C for 10 min and the surface and cross section SEM images of textured Si wafers with different MACE etching time are shown in Fig. 5(a, b, d, e, g, h, j, k). It was revealed that the sizes of pyramid structure were strongly dependent on the MACE etching time. For example, much smaller pyramid structures on T-0 and T-90 were observed compared to T-30 and T-60. And the significant role of MACE etching time in controlling the size distribution and uniformity of pyramid structures was demonstrated in Fig. 5(c, f, i, l). The size of pyramid structure on T-0 distributed mainly in the range of 0.5\u20132 \u00b5m with a mean value of 1.48 \u00b5m (Fig. 5(c)). Regarding T-30, mean size raised to 3.46 \u00b5m accompanied with a SD value of 1.45 \u00b5m, indicating a virtually 1.97 \u00b5m increase of pyramid structure size compared to the T-0 case. A further increase of MACE etching time to 60 s resulted in a slight decrease of pyramid structure size with the mean value of 2.95 \u00b5m shown in Fig. 5(g, h, i). When it came to T-90, pyramid size dropped dramatically, producing the smallest average size of 1.34 \u00b5m along with the SD value of 0.95 \u00b5m (Fig. 5(j, k, l)). The reflectance of textured silicon wafers with varied MACE etching time was measured over the wavelength range of 300\u20131100 nm, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Compared to T-30 and T-60, T-0 and T-90 exhibited relatively higher reflectance due to their smaller microstructures. Actually, the smaller structures made the incoming light undergo only one or two bounce before being reflected away, resulting in worse light-trapping ability. SEM images of T-30 and T-60 showed larger size of pyramid structure compared to T-0 and T-90, leading to relatively better light-trapping ability. T-60 achieved the minimum reflectance of 10.3% and offered lower reflectance than T-30 due to the relatively uniform size distribution, corresponding to the SD values shown in Fig. 5(f, i). Meanwhile, the thickness losses of textured silicon wafers were measured and presented in Fig. 6(b). Thickness reduction of sample T-B was nearly 3.5 \u00b5m. As a comparison, inferior losses in thickness of samples T-0~T-90 were obtained, showing great potential in commercial utilization. Reduced thickness increased with the incremental MACE etching time and the mean thickness losses of T-0, T-30, T-60 and T-90 were 0.17 \u00b5m, 1.02 \u00b5m, 1.30 \u00b5m and 1.52 \u00b5m, respectively, exhibiting the similar tendency as the depths of BS layers. Figs. 5 and 6 depicted an interesting phenomenon that the MACE process affected the size distribution of pyramid structure and a mechanism was proposed to explain that results. As shown in Fig. 7, silicon wafers were classified in three types based on the porosity of nanostructure on the surface, including bare silicon, low-porosity BS and high-porosity BS, corresponding to different MACE etching time. The difference started from the nucleation procedure. Owing to the above-mentioned depressing effect of low concentration of OH- ions on anode reaction, the pyramid structure slowly nucleated and grew up, resulting in small size pyramid structure on bare silicon sample. After MACE process, the vertically aligned nanostructures had much higher specific surface area, providing plenty of surface atoms as well as dangling bonds, easier being the preferential sites for nucleation of pyramid structure. Hence, pyramid structure quickly nucleated on the low-porosity BS sample, as a consequence, microstructure in larger size was prepared. However, with respect to high-porosity BS sample, the porous layer could be divided into two parts and the top layer would be etched away, leaving the bottom porous layer as the nucleation preferential sites. Afterwards, microstructure in relatively smaller size was obtained. In addition, thickness differences among the three types of samples can be noted. As shown in Fig. 7, \u0394d1 inferred the thickness difference between textured bare silicon and textured low-porosity BS, \u0394d2 inferred the thickness difference between textured low-porosity BS and textured high-porosity BS. The connection between \u0394d1 and \u0394d2 could be supported by the thickness losses shown in Fig. 6(b). In order to further prove our proposed mechanism, SEM images of BS-30 textured in low-concentration alkaline solution for different time are shown in Fig. 8. Compared to Fig. 8(a), after two minutes texturization, surface morphology in Fig. 8(b) greatly changed. A great quantity of small pyramid structure emerged and fully covered the silicon surface, indicating that nucleation procedure was accelerated by the nanostructure. With the increase in etching time, pyramid structure in Fig. 8(c, d) grew larger and larger by the merging of small microstructures with each other. 4 Conclusions In summary, we reported a nanostructure-induced texturization method in low-concentration alkaline solution and pyramid structures with good morphologies and antireflective effect were successfully prepared within 10 min. Compared with standard-concentration electrolyte, low-concentration electrolyte shows its benefits in controlling uniformity of microstructures by depressing the anode reaction. However, it met the challenge of short-time texturization due to its slow etching rates, and therefore the MACE process was employed. With varied MACE etching time ranging from 30 s to 90 s, vertically aligned nanostructures with different depths and morphologies were obtained. Subsequently, pyramid-like microstructures with distinct sizes were prepared at 78 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C within 10 min. In addition, optimized reflectance of 10.3% with less thickness losses than employing standard-concentration case was achieved. Based on our results, we speculated that nanostructures of the BS layers enlarged the specific surface area, resulting in much more dangling bonds exposed to OH- ions, in consequence, cathode reaction was supposed to be promoted. Therefore, nanostructures acted as the preferential sites for nucleation and hence accelerated the texturization process. This report manifested that short-time, low-concentration and less silicon consumption texturization of mono-crystalline silicon wafers could be achieved by one-step MACE-induced method, exhibiting great potential in commercial photovoltaics, and furthermore, in ultrathin silicon solar cells.
