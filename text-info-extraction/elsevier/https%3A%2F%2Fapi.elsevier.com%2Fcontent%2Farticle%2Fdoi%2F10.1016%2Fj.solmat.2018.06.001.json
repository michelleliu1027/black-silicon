Department of Applied Physics, College of Science, Huzhou University Huzhou Zhejiang 313000 PR China Nanotextured diamond-wire sawing (DWS) multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells are successfully fabricated on an industrial scale. The nanotextures are achieved through reactive ion etching (RIE). By introducing the RIE-nanotextures, the DWS mc-Si solar cells with aluminum back-surface field (Al-BSF) structure exhibit an enhanced optoelectronic conversion, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 19.50%. This enhanced optoelectronic conversion is attributed to nanotexture-induced photon management effect, including both efficient reflection reduction and absorption enhancement, and which offset over the increased recombination of charge carriers. The DWS mc-Si solar cells are promising for industrial production due to the low raw material cost, high PCE, and manufacturing processes compatible with the existing production lines. Graphical abstract fx1 Keywords DWS mc-Si solar cells Nanotexturing Reactive ion etching Photon management Enhanced optoelectronic conversion 1 Introduction Recently, photovoltaic (PV) materials and PV devices have attracted considerable interests since solar cells offer a practical approach to convert solar energy into electricity directly. Multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells have occupied 65\u201375% of the PV market. However, the price of mc-Si solar cells still needs to be further reduced in order to compete with the fossil fuel based energy. In a typical mc-Si solar cell, the material cost of silicon wafer is about 63% of the overall cost of fabricating solar cells [1]. Since crystalline silicon is a weak absorber [2], and the commercial mc-Si solar cells adopt 180\u2013200\u202f\u00b5m thick active layer to adequately absorb the sun light. Furthermore, slicing mc-Si ingot into mc-Si wafer causes a material loss of more than 50% if the conventional slurry wire sawing (SWS) technique is used. Currently, diamond-wire sawing (DWS) technique [3,4] is being applied to the slicing of mc-Si ingot. DWS technique has several advantages such as a three-times faster sawing speed, low material loss, recyclable sawing silicon powder, and reduced material cost of USD 4.5\u20138 cents per piece for mc-Si wafer compared to that of the conventional SWS process. It is obvious that DWS is an efficient way to produce low cost mc-Si wafers for solar cells. Unfortunately, the light reflection loss of DWS mc-Si solar cells with conventional wet acidic etching (WAE) process [5] is 3\u20135% higher than that of SWS mc-Si solar cells, due to less surface mechanical damage and smooth surface of DWS mc-Si wafers. Conventionally prepared DWS mc-Si solar cells are less effective to convert solar energy. Many new texturing technologies [6,7] may be available for DWS mc-Si solar cells, such as metal catalysed chemical etching (MCCE) [8\u201310], reactive ion etching (RIE) [11,12], atmospheric pressure F2 based dry etching [13\u201315], laser etching [16] and plasma immersion ion implantation [17,18]. MCCE is a low cost texturing process and has been reported for texturing of DWS mc-Si solar cells [19\u201321]. However, MCCE needs to use heavy metal ions [22] such as Ag+, which lead to environmental pollution. RIE is another effective surface nanotexturing process for mc-Si solar cells [11,12]. RIE processing mc-Si solar cells can achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) [12,23]. In the RIE process, the product of SixOyFz presents a self-mask effect [24], facilitating the formation of nanotextured surface on crystalline silicon. Even though DWS mc-Si wafers have less surface mechanical damage and smooth surface, a uniform nanotextured surface can be obtained by RIE process due to the etching mechanism of the self-mask. Thus, RIE process would be very suitable for the surface texturing of DWS mc-Si solar cells. As a result, it is essential to demonstrate the application potential of RIE process for low cost DWS mc-Si solar cells as compared to that of conventional WAE process [5], and to understand the optoelectronic conversion process in the RIE-nanotextured DWS mc-Si solar cells. In this work, RIE-nanotextured DWS mc-Si solar cells with aluminum back-surface field (Al-BSF) architecture have been fabricated on an industrial scale. The optoelectronic conversion of the RIE-nanotextured DWS mc-Si solar cells are investigated as compared to that of conventional WAE process. By the reflection spectra, transmittance spectra and quantum efficiency, we identify that photon management through the surface nanotexturing plays a critical role on optoelectronic conversion performance of RIE-nanotextured DWS mc-Si solar cells. 2 Experiment P-type DWS mc-Si (200\u202f\u00b1\u202f20\u202f\u00b5m thick, 1\u20133\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm) wafers with a standard size of 156.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f156.75\u202fmm2 were used in this work. The wafers were first processed with conventional wet acidic etching [5] to produce micropit structures. The wafers were then treated with RIE process [25] to generate nanotextures. In the RIE process, the gas mixture of SF6, O2 and Cl2 with flow ratio of 17:24:10 was employed to etch DWS mc-Si wafers at a pressure of 30\u202fPa. After the RIE process, the DWS mc-Si wafers were cleaned using a BOE/H2O2 solution (BOE, mixed aqueous solution of NH4F and HF) and HF solution, respectively. The resulting RIE-nanotextures on the surface of the mc-Si wafers were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi, S3400N). The hemispherical reflectance spectra and transmittance spectra of processed DWS mc-Si wafers were obtained by UV\u2013visible-near infrared spectroscopy with an integrating sphere attachment (Shimadzu, UV-2600). The two series of DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures (500 cells for each series) were prepared using standard industrial processes [26,27]. All cells were Al-BSF architecture with 5 bus-bars. The fabrication processes of the DWS mc-Si solar cells were illustrated in Fig. 1. After surface texturing, POCl3 based tube diffusion was employed to form p-n junction emitter. In the diffusion process, the sheet resistances of the emitter of all cells were controlled in the range of 100\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202f\u03a9/\u25a1. The high sheet resistance is beneficial to diminish the surface and bulk recombination of photo-generated carriers in the nanotextured emitter [8,28]. Then the phosphorous doping layer of wafer back surface and wafer edge were removed by wet etching in a HF/HNO3 solution. The SiNx antireflection/passivation coating was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The thickness of the SiNx coating for all cells was about 80\u202fnm. Finally, Ag and Al paste was subsequently screen printed on both the front and rear surfaces to form top/bottom electrodes. The performance of the DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures were characterized by standard solar simulated light illumination (AM 1.5\u202fG, 100\u202fmW/cm2) (Berger Lichttechnik, PSS10), and the corresponding quantum efficiency (QE) were identified at solar cell spectral response measurement system (Zolix, SCS100-Std). 3 Results and discussion Figs. 2 (a) and 2 (b). shows the SEM images of surface morphology of DWS mc-Si wafers processed by WAE. Some micropits can be observed on the mc-Si wafer. However, both the number and density of the micropits are found to be lower than that of the WAE processing SWS mc-Si wafers [5], which can be ascribed to less surface mechanical damage and smooth surface of DWS mc-Si wafers. High packing density RIE-nanotextures with pseudo-pyramidal shape are found on the surface of DWS mc-Si wafers after the RIE process and BOE/H2O2 modification, as shown in Figs. 2 (c) and 2 (d). The pseudo-pyramidal configuration is easy to achieve conformally deposition of SiNx film on the nanotextures [9]. The size of pseudo-pyramids is about 250\u2013420 nm, which can efficiently diffract sun light, and consequently suppresses the surface reflection. The hemispherical reflection spectra of the RIE-nanotextured DWS mc-Si wafer are shown in Fig. 3 (a). as compared to the surface of the DWS mc-Si wafer without RIE-nanotextures. The DWS mc-Si wafers decorated with RIE-nanotextures exhibit a lower optical reflection in the range of 300\u20131100 nm. After the deposition of SiNx coating on the surface of DWS mc-Si wafer, the hemispherical reflection is further reduced. In addition, the effective transmittance spectra T E ( \u03bb ) are obtained using equation T E ( \u03bb ) = T M ( \u03bb ) / ( 1 \u2212 R M ( \u03bb ) ) , where R M ( \u03bb ) is the measuring reflectance, and T M ( \u03bb ) is the measuring transmittance. As shown in Fig. 3 (b), a reduced optical transmission is observed in the range of 900\u20131100 nm, after the introduction of RIE-nanotextures. To further evaluate the light-trapping capability of the nano-textured DWS mc-Si wafer, the reflection loss ratio \u03b7 R in the range of 300\u20131100 nm and effective transmittance loss ratio \u03b7 T in the range of 900\u20131100 nm are described by the following Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) \u03b7 R = \u222b 300 n m 1100 n m R M ( \u03bb ) I A M 1.5 G ( \u03bb ) ( h c / \u03bb ) d \u03bb \u222b 300 n m 1100 n m I A M 1.5 G ( \u03bb ) ( h c / \u03bb ) d \u03bb (2) \u03b7 T = \u222b 900 n m 1100 n m T E ( \u03bb ) I A M 1.5 G ( \u03bb ) ( h c / \u03bb ) d \u03bb \u222b 900 n m 1100 n m I A M 1.5 G ( \u03bb ) ( h c / \u03bb ) d \u03bb Where \u03bb is the wavelength, h is the Planck constant, and c is the light speed, and I A M 1.5 G is the AM1.5 G solar spectrum [29], while the results obtained are summarized in Table 1. After introducing the RIE-nanotextures, the reflection loss ratio of the SiNx coating DWS mc-Si wafer is reduced from 8.05% to 3.19% in the range of 300\u20131100 nm. The results demonstrate that the RIE-nanotextures can effectively reduce surface reflection of DWS mc-Si wafer. On the other hand, the effective transmittance loss ratio of the SiNx coated DWS mc-Si wafer is also reduced from 12.02% to 6.59% in the range of 900\u20131100 nm. It can be concluded that the RIE-nanotextures can effectively increase the absorption path of photons, thus enhance absorption in the DWS mc-Si wafer. Based on the comparative analysis of the measured results in Fig. 3, it can be concluded that the RIE-nanotextures on the surface of DWS mc-Si wafers play a critical role in both the efficient reflection reduction and absorption enhancement, which is attributed to the nanotexture-induced photon management effect. Fig. 4. shows the performance parameter distributions of the DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures. From these statistical results, it can be clearly seen that the short-circuit current density (J sc ) of the RIE-nanotextured cells is significantly higher than that of the cells without the RIE-nanotextures. However, the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of the RIE-nanotextured cells is lower than that of the cells without RIE-nanotextures. In addition, the RIE-nanotextured cells show small improvement in fill factor (FF). Finally, the RIE-nanotextured cells exhibit higher PCE values in comparison to the reference textured cells. Thus, we demonstrate that the presence of RIE-nanotextures can effectively enhance the photoelectric conversion of the DWS mc-Si solar cells. The detailed performance parameters of the series of DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures are summarized in Table 2. By introducing the RIE-nanotextures, the average J sc is increased by 1.25 \u00b1 0.23 mA/cm2, and an increased value of (0.53 \u00b1 0.18)% in the average PCE is achieved. The highest PCE of the RIE-nanotextured cells has been reached up to 19.50%. The PCE improvement for the best cell with RIE-nanotextures is of up to 0.78% as compared to the best cell without RIE-nanotextures. Additionally, the average J sc and the average FF of the RIE-nanotextured mc-Si solar cells increase by 3.52% and 0.45%, respectively, while the average open circuit voltage decreases by 0.99%. The increased ratio of the average J sc is about one order of magnitude higher than that of the average FF, thus, the higher PCE can be mainly ascribed to the increased J sc . To get more insight on the enhanced J sc , two typical cells (one without and one with RIE-nanotextures) are picked from each series of DWS mc-Si solar cells. The performance parameters (J sc , V oc , FF and PCE) of both cells are close to the average values of performance parameter of each series cells, respectively. The current density versus voltage (J\u2013V) curves of the typical DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures were measured under standard solar simulated light illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW/cm2), as shown in Fig. 5 (a). It clearly indicates that the RIE-nanotextured cell has an enhanced J sc . By introducing the RIE-nanotextures, the color of the DWS mc-Si solar cell changes from dark blue to black (as shown in the inset of Fig. 5 (a).). This change of color suggests a lower optical reflection in the RIE-nanotextured cell. The EQE spectra of the typical DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures are shown in Fig. 5 (b). Compared to the cell without RIE-nanotextures, the cell with RIE-nanotextures shows an improved EQE in both the short wavelength range of 350\u2013550 nm and the long wavelength range of 750\u20131100 nm. This result agrees well with the J sc indicated in J\u2013V curves. The improved light response can be attributed to the suppression in the surface reflection, as depicted in the comparative hemispherical reflectance spectra (Fig. 3 (a).). The IQE spectra of the typical DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures are shown in the inset of Fig. 5 (b). In the wavelength range of 350\u2013600 nm, the RIE-nanotextured cell exhibits a lower IQE values. The physical mechanism of the lower IQE can be attributed to the enhanced surface recombination and bulk recombination of photo-generated charge carriers in the nanotextured emitter [8,28]. However, higher IQE of the RIE-nanotextured cell is obtained in the long wavelength range of 850\u20131100 nm. The absorption coefficient of the long wavelength photons in range of 850\u20131100 nm is too low [2], and long wavelength photons have a much longer penetration depth into DWS mc-Si solar cells. These characteristics of the long wavelength photons can result in a higher parasitic absorption loss in back Al electrode and more recombination of photo-generated charge carriers on back surface. However, the RIE-nanotextures can effectively increase the absorption path of photons, leading to an enhanced light absorption in the RIE-nanotextured cell. As a result, more long wavelength photons are trapped and absorbed near the top of the RIE-nanotextured cell, thus both the parasitic absorption loss of long wavelength photons in back Al electrode and the recombination loss of photo-generated charge carriers on back surface are reduced. Thus, the higher IQE values for long wavelength in the RIE-nanotextured cells can be expected. Based on the comparative analysis mentioned above, it can be concluded that the higher J sc of the RIE-nanotextured cells is attributed to the photon management effect through the surface nanotexturing, including the efficient reflection reduction and absorption enhancement. In order to further understand the role of the RIE-nanotextures on the optoelectronic conversion, we calculated the reverse saturation current density (J 0 ) of the DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures by the well-known Eq. (3). (3) V O C = k T q ln ( J S C J 0 + 1 ) \u2248 k T q ln ( J S C J 0 ) Where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Based on the average V oc and average J sc (in Table 2), the average J 0 are calculated to be (8.75 \u00b1 1.33)\u00d7 10\u221210 mA/cm2 and (11.52 \u00b1 2.31)\u00d7 10\u221210 mA/cm2 for DWS mc-Si solar cells without and with RIE-nanotextures, respectively, which is enhanced by (31.65\u00b1 10.98)%. The difference in the J 0 between the two series cells is due to the difference in the front surface structure introduced by the RIE-nanotextures. Upon using the RIE-nanotextures, the front side of the cells has a larger surface area and larger junction area, which will lead to enhance surface recombination and bulk recombination of charge carriers [8,28]. In addition, surface defects due to ion bombardment during the RIE process can also induce an increased surface recombination of charge carriers [30]. Thus, the higher J 0 and the lower V oc of the RIE-nanotextured cells can be attributed to the increased recombination of charge carriers by the RIE-nanotextured surface and RIE-induced surface defects. Based on above results and discussion, we demonstrate that the RIE processing DWS mc-Si solar cells have a photon management effect through the surface nanotexturing, which can effectively improve light response, resulting in an enhanced J sc . However, the RIE-nanotextures also lead to an increased recombination of charge carriers in the DWS mc-Si solar cells, resulting in a lower V oc . The photon management through the surface nanotexturing can offset over the increased recombination of charge carriers in the RIE processing DWS mc-Si solar cells, and an enhanced optoelectronic conversion is achieved. The RIE process will increase the fabrication cost of the mc-Si solar cells by about USD 4.0\u20135.0 cents per piece. However, the low cost DWS mc-Si wafers are used as raw material for the mc-Si solar cells. The raw material cost is reduced by about USD 4.5\u20138.0 cents per piece, and the total cell cost can be effectively reduced. Moreover, RIE process is fully compatible with the existing production lines. Therefore, RIE can be considered as an alternative surface nanotexturing process for cost-effective DWS mc-Si solar cells in industrial production. 4 Conclusions In summary, RIE is demonstrated as an alternative surface nanotexturing process for low cost DWS mc-Si solar cells. The RIE-nanotextures can effectively enhance the optoelectronic conversion in the DWS mc-Si solar cells, which results in high PCE of up to 19.5%. This enhanced optoelectronic conversion is attributed to nanotexture-induced photon management effect in the RIE processing DWS mc-Si solar cells, including both efficient reflection reduction and absorption enhancement. The DWS mc-Si solar cells are promising for industrial production due to the low raw material cost, high PCE, and manufacturing processes compatible with the existing production lines.
