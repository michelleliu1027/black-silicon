Silicon solar cell texturing is the process of reducing the light reflection of the solar cells by changing their surface structure. Given that multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers have grains with different orientations, their texturing process is more difficult to realize compared with those of monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) wafers. There are two types of texturing processes: wet and dry texturing. Acidic solution-based wet-textured mc-Si samples have higher reflectance values than mono-Si wafers. However, the reactive ion etching (RIE)-texturing of mc-Si wafers has the advantage of decreasing reflectance to values below 10%. Despite this decrease in reflectance, RIE byproducts and plasma-induced damage bring about recombination that results in a decrease the passivation properties of the solar cell. In this study, the RIE byproducts as well as the plasma-induced damage of the RIE-textured mc-Si wafers were analyzed using SEM, STEM, and EDS analysis, while quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) was used to confirm the optical characteristics of the RIE-textured mc-Si wafers. Additionally, HF treatment resulted in byproduct removal, and a relatively high implied Voc (673 mV) was confirmed within 3 min of HF treatment. The defect removal etching (DRE) process using KOH was applied to remove the lattice defect layer, and after 40 s of the DRE treatment, the implied Voc increased to ~ 680 mV. Thus, the RIE-textured mc-Si solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 19.6%, which was ~ 0.6% higher than that of acid-textured mc-Si solar cells based on the increase in short-circuit current (Isc). Keywords Solar cell Multi-crystalline silicon wafer RIE Passivation Byproduct Plasma-induced damage 1 Introduction Silicon solar cells, which account for more than 90% of the solar energy market, can be classified as monocrystalline (mono-Si) or multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells. To bring about their ingot growth, the solidification method, which entails a lower cost, is often preferred to the Czochralski method. However, given that mc-Si wafers are more reflective than their mono-Si counterparts, owing to the random orientation of their crystalline wafers that make isotropic etching impossible, various texturing processes have been investigated so as to improve their efficiency as solar cells. Texturing methods for mc-Si solar cells can be divided into wet etching and dry etching. Wet etching is often adopted for solar cell mass production, owing to its simplicity and low process cost compared to dry etching. Additionally, due to the random orientation of crystals in the mc-Si wafers, they are preferably produced using anisotropic etching rather than isotropic etching [1\u20133]. Wet texturing employs a mixture solution of nitric acid (HNO3), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has isotropic etching effects on silicon wafers [4\u20136], and when isotropic etching is used, a reflectance higher than that of monocrystalline silicon wafers is be obtained [7\u20139]. Additionally, previous studies have reported that metal-catalyzed etching (MACE), which employs noble metal ions, can effectively reduce the reflectance of mc-Si wafers [10\u201312]. However, it is difficult to reduce the cost of this texturing method, owing to the defects caused by metal ion impurities. Furthermore, additional costs are also associated with the equipment needed to recycle the noble metal ions. Examples of dry etching methods include mechanical etching [13,14], laser etching [15\u201317], and reactive ion etching (RIE), which has the advantage of lowering the surface reflectivity of mc-Si solar cells because the etching gases react and texture with the silicon surface into a high energy plasma state [18\u201320]. Reportedly, when the RIE process is applied to monocrystalline silicon wafers, a high efficiency solar cell with an efficiency of 22.1% can be manufactured in an IBC structure [21]. However, when the silicon wafer surface obtains a high aspect ratio as a result of the RIE process, Auger recombination greatly increases, owing to the highly doped region formed during the doping process, possibly resulting in a decrease the efficiency [22]. Additionally, an increase in the number of recombination sites brought about by plasma-induced damage results in a decrease in solar cell power conversion efficiency. Plasma-induced damage can be classified as UV damage, which results from plasma light, and ion collision damage, which results from the collision of ions with high energy plasma process-generated byproducts. However, given that UV damage does not significantly affect the crystalline structure of silicon, in this study, ion collision damage was rather considered. The surface byproducts formed during the RIE process result in an increase in carrier recombination rates, and the silicon surface defect layer is formed as a result of the collision of plasma ions with high energy byproducts [23\u201325]. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the defects generated on the surface to ensure that the efficiency of the RIE process-fabricated mc-Si solar cell is high. Several studies on the removal of RIE-induced defect have been reported. For example, Kumaravela et al. reported that performing defect removal etching (DRE) using an acid mixture solution consisting of HNO3 and HF in the ratio 50:1 to remove RIE-induced defects resulted in an improved carrier lifetime [26]. Additionally, Ruby at el. Reported that using the MACE process in combination with the RIE process brought about a decrease in reflectance when the DRE process was performed using an acid mixture solution, coupled with a solution of KOH, thus improving quantum efficiency in the UV and visible light regions [27]. Xiao reported that cells obtained after a DRE process that employed a solution containing HNO3, HF, and H2O in the ratio 20:1:35 (vol%), and another containing NaNO2, HF, and H2O in the ratio 6.4g:10 ml:240 ml, showed an efficiency of 17.46% [28]. Furthermore, Park reported that RIE process generated byproducts could be removed using HF solution [29]. In this study, the byproducts as well as the defect layers resulting from the RIE process were separately analyzed, and removed using wet etching. The byproducts were characterized using SEM, STEM, and EDS analyses, while STEM contrast analysis was used to confirm the presence of defect layers. 2 Experimental A multi-crystalline p-type silicon wafer (thickness, 180 \u03bcm; area, 156.75 mm \u00d7 156.75 mm; and resistivity, 1.5 \u03a9cm) was used, and in accordance with the dry etching method, the samples were prepared to obtain RIE-textured samples, while wet-textured samples were prepared using an acid mixture solution containing HNO3, HF, and DI in the ratio 6:1:7 (vol%) at 10 \u00b0C for 180 s. For the RIE samples, saw damage removal was conducted using 20 wt% KOH at 80 \u00b0C for 200 s, after which the RIE process was performed for 125 s at 19 kW under 35 Pa RF plasma using a mixture of Cl2, SF6, and O2 in the ratio 1.2:1:2. After RIE treatment, HF was used at room temperature to remove the byproducts on the surface of the mc-Si wafers. Thereafter, plasma-induced damage was removed using the DRE process, which employed KOH. With the emitter at a sheet resistivity between 75 and 80 \u03a9/\u25a1 and using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as the front passivation, a silicon nitride film (SiNx), ~ 75 nm thick, was formed. With 10 nm thick thermal atomic layer deposited Al2O3 as rear side passivation, PECVD resulted in the deposition of a SiNx film that was ~ 150 nm thick. Ag and Al electrodes were formed using screen printing. To analyze the surface structure of the mc-Si wafers, SEM and STEM images were obtained. Byproduct components were determined using EDS, reflectance was measured using a V-670 spectrophotometer (JASCO), while quantum efficiency was characterized using a QEX-10 equipment (PV measurement). To measure refractive index and thickness, an ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.) was used, and the passivation and light I\u2013V characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Sinton's WCT-120 equipment and a McScience's K201 LAB160 solar simulator, respectively, under 1 Sun condition. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the reflectance of the wet and dry etched samples. The reflectance of the surface of the samples that were wet-textured using an acid mixture solution was ~ 21.49%, representing a decrease of ~ 7% compared with the as-cut sample. The RIE-textured samples showed a reflectivity of 9.89%, which was lower than that of the wet-textured sample. SEM was used to analyze the morphology of the silicon surface with respect to the sample texturing method that was used, and Fig. 2 shows the results that were obtained. Fig. 2 (a) and (d), which represent the cross section SEM images of the as-cut samples revealed the presence of ~ 5 \u03bcm deep cracks, which seemed to be a surface defect resulting from wafer sawing [30,31], while Fig. 2 (b) and (c) represent the planar SEM images of samples after wet and RIE texturing, respectively. Although Fig. 2 (d) shows that the cracks had been removed, the subsequent passivation process was not effective given that some surfaces were almost vertical. Fig. 2 (e) and (f) represent the cross sectional images of the acid-textured wafers and the RIE-textured wafers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 (d), RIE treatment resulted in crack removal. Furthermore, the surface structure of the RIE-textured samples was relatively smaller than that of the wet-textured sample. However, RIE-texturing resulted in the formation of byproducts on the silicon surface of the samples. These byproducts prevent the elimination of dangling bonds that induce minority carrier recombination during the passivation process [18\u201320]. Therefore, before removing the byproducts, EDS analysis was performed to identify them. Fig. 3 (a) shows the STEM analysis and EDS mapping images of the RIE-textured silicon surfaces, while Fig. 3 (b) depicts the point scan of the area demarcated in Fig. 3 (a) following EDS analysis. Additionally, Fig. 3 (a) revealed that silicon, the byproducts, and oxygen were distributed throughout the wafer, on the wafer, and in the byproducts, respectively. Fluorine EDS mapping showed that in the byproducts, only a small quantity of fluorine was present, while it was absent inside the silicon. These EDS results are similar to those of a previous study, which identified SiOxFy as the byproduct generated during the RIE process [23]. To obtain a more accurate result, a point analysis of the byproduct using STEM was conducted, and as shown in Fig. 3 (b), carbon was detected owing to the deposition of an organic solvent on the silicon surface. Additionally, the ratio of silicon to oxygen in the RIE process byproduct was found to be 1:2, while the percentage of fluorine, chlorine, and sulfur atoms, which are constituents of the gases employed during the RIE process were all <0.1 atomic %. For fluorine in particular, this atomic percentage was found to be unreliable because it was in the error range. Thus, it was reasoned that fluorine was not detected because of the optimization of the RIE process pressure condition [32]. HF was used to remove the byproducts, which consisted of oxygen and silicon, and the reflectance of the RIE-textured wafers was characterized as a function of HF treatment time. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 4 . The reflectance of the RIE-textured samples without byproduct removal using HF in the short and long wavelength regions were higher and lower, respectively, than those of the RIE-textured samples with byproduct removal using HF. These changes in reflectance possibly resulted from the removal of the by-products from the silicon surfaces via HF treatment. Fig. 5 shows the cross section SEM images of the RIE-textured mc-Si wafers as a function of HF treatment time. Particularly, Fig. 5 (a) revealed the presence of RIE byproducts prior to HF treatment, while Fig. 5 (b) and (c), which represent the SEM images after 3 and 10 min HF treatments, respectively, showed no byproducts. Given that the byproducts were removed following HF treatment, the surface recombination characteristics of the samples after the passivation process were analyzed as a function of HF treatment time, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 6 . Particularly, Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show the implied Voc and minority carrier lifetime of the mc-Si wafers as a function of HF treatment time, respectively. Generally, a comparison of the surface passivation characteristics showed that regardless of HF treatment time, the surface conditions were the same. However, given that wafer bowing occurred after the RIE process, the front side surface passivation characteristics of the RIE-processed samples were measured. Passivation was performed with SiNx as a function of HF treatment time, and as shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), the implied Voc of the HF-treated samples within 3 min was 673 mV. Compared with the implied Voc of saw damage removed and RIE-textured samples without HF treatment (i.e., 683 and 639 mV, respectively), that of the HF-treated RIE-textured samples indicated that the silicon surface resulting from RIE texturing was well covered during the passivation process. Additionally, there was a decrease in the implied Voc of the samples that were treated for more than 3 min. This could result from chemical damage following HF treatment. Ion induced damage resulting from ion collision with high-energy plasma on the silicon surface can be observed during the RIE process [33,34]. To remove this damage, defect removal etching (DRE) was performed using dilute KOH solution. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show the implied Voc characteristics and minority carrier lifetime of the silicon wafers, as a function of DRE treatment time, respectively. As the DRE treatment time increased up to 40 s, the implied Voc characteristics of both sides of the SiNx-passivated samples were improved. Samples treated for over 40 s retained an implied Voc of ~ 680 mV, which indicated an improvement in surface passivation characteristics as plasma-induced surface damage was removed. Fig. 8 (a) shows the variation of reflectance with DRE treatment time, while Fig. 8 (b) shows the variation of the weighted reflectance of the samples with and without the DRE treatment and SiNx deposition. As DRE treatment time increased, the surface reflectivity of the RIE-treated mc-Si wafers increased, and considering the reflectance and the passivation property, the optimized DRE treatment time was found to be 40 s. STEM contrast analysis was performed to confirm the removal of the plasma-induced damage layer using DRE treatment, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 9 . Particularly, Fig. 9 (a) and (c) represent HAADF (High-Angle Annular Dark Field) and BF (Bright Field) STEM images, respectively, before DRE treatment, while (b) and (d) represent HAADF and BF STEM images, respectively, 40 s after DRE treatment. As opposed to Fig. 9 (c), Fig. 9 (a) showed the presence of silicon with a contrast of ~ 2 nm deep on the silicon surface. This contrast difference seems to be an amorphous phase resulting from plasma-induced damage owing to the RIE process [29,30]. Fig. 9 (b) shows that the plasma-induced damage was removed following the 40 s DRE treatment since no surface contrast difference was observed. Following 3 min and 40 s HF and DRE treatments, respectively, the RIE-textured mc-Si wafers showed the lowest reflectance and highest surface passivation properties. To compare wet texturing and RIE texturing, a silicon solar cell with a passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) structure was fabricated. Fig. 10 (a) represents the implied Voc characteristics of the PERC structure solar cell as a function of the surface texturing method. The implied Voc characteristics of the RIE-textured mc-Si wafers were similar or better than those of the wet-etched mc-Si wafers by 672.7 mV. Fig. 10 (b) and (c) show the I\u2013V and EQE characteristics of the RIE-textured mc-Si solar cells, which showed a conversion efficiency of ~ 19.6%. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), its open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc), and fill factor were ~ 0.650 V, 9.008 A, and ~ 79%, respectively. Table 1 shows the LIV characteristics of the multi-crystalline PERC structure silicon solar cells as a function of the surface texturing method. The RIE-textured mc-Si solar cells showed an Voc characteristic of ~ 0.650 V, which was 1 mV greater than that of the wet-textured mc-Si solar cells, an observation that was also supported by Fig. 10 (a). Compared with wet texturing, RIE texturing resulted in an increase in light absorption, that brought about an improvement in Isc and efficiency of 0.2 mA/cm2 and ~ 0.6%, respectively. 4 Conclusions In mc-Si solar cells, surface texturing processes are important processes that could improve short-circuit current, as well as increase light absorption. In this study, mc-Si cells were fabricated using wet texturing, which employed an acid mixture solution, and dry texturing, which employed the RIE process. Thereafter, the effects of these texturing methods on the reflectance characteristics and light conversion efficiency of the solar cells were investigated. Even though reflectance can be lowered via the RIE process, the passivation characteristics of the solar cells were lowered by RIE byproducts and plasma-induced wafer surface damage. EDS analysis and STEM image showed that the byproduct consisted of silicon and oxygen, and existed as an amorphous state, while STEM contrast analysis confirmed the presence of a plasma-induced damage layer on the silicon surface. When the byproducts were removed using HF treatment for 3 min, an implied Voc of 673 mV was observed, and after DRE removal of plasma-induced damage using KOH solution, the implied Voc increased to ~ 680 mV after 40 s. Therefore, RIE texturing resulted in mc-Si solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 19.6%, which was ~ 0.6% greater than that of the wet-textured multi-crystalline PERC silicon solar cells.

Given that multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers have grains with different orientations, their texturing process is more difficult to realize compared with those of monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) wafers. There are two types of texturing processes: wet and dry texturing. Acidic solution-based wet-textured mc-Si samples have higher reflectance values than mono-Si wafers. However, the reactive ion etching (RIE)-texturing of mc-Si wafers has the advantage of decreasing reflectance to values below 10%. Despite this decrease in reflectance, RIE byproducts and plasma-induced damage bring about recombination that results in a decrease the passivation properties of the solar cell. In this study, the RIE byproducts as well as the plasma-induced damage of the RIE-textured mc-Si wafers were analyzed using SEM, STEM, and EDS analysis, while quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) was used to confirm the optical characteristics of the RIE-textured mc-Si wafers. Additionally, HF treatment resulted in byproduct removal, and a relatively high implied Voc (673 mV) was confirmed within 3 min of HF treatment. The defect removal etching (DRE) process using KOH was applied to remove the lattice defect layer, and after 40 s of the DRE treatment, the implied Voc increased to ~ 680 mV. Thus, the RIE-textured mc-Si solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 19.6%, which was ~ 0.6% higher than that of acid-textured mc-Si solar cells based on the increase in short-circuit current (Isc).", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2020-04-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url":
