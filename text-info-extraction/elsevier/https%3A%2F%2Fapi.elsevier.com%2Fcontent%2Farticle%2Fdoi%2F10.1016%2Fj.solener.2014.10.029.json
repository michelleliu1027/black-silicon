Communicated by: Associate Editor Igor Tyukhov 17.3% efficient black silicon (b-Si) solar cell without antireflection coating was achieved via tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) etching after the formation of the diffusion emitter. Large area (156\u00d7156mm2) b-Si wafers were prepared by silver-nanoparticle-assisted etching on pyramid-structured silicon wafers. The modification of nanostructures of silicon surface by TMAH etching suppresses the surface recombination and Auger recombination at and near the emitter surface, and the effective minority carrier lifetime of the b-Si solar cells was improved from 10.7\u03bcs to 20.8\u03bcs. Although the average reflectance of the b-Si solar cell slightly increases from 2.38% to 2.71% via the process of TMAH etching, it is a small loss compared with the beneficial impact of the improvement of the carrier recombination lifetime. As a result, the internal quantum efficiency at short wavelength region was improved through the TMAH etch treatment, which was a main limiting factor for the efficiency of b-Si solar cells. Keywords Black silicon Solar cell Doping concentration Carrier recombination 1 Introduction For crystalline silicon solar cells, improving the conversation efficiency is one of the most important and challenging problems. It is known that antireflection films on solar cells work effectively only in a limited wavelength range and limited incident light angles. In order to more effectively reduce light loss, texturing on front surfaces is frequently used to create light trapping to improve the efficiency of solar cells. Recently, the black silicon (b-Si) has attracted much attention due to its excellent antireflection (AR) property (Peng et al., 2005; Srivastava et al., 2010). Several b-Si etching methods have been developed, including reactive ion etching (Moreno et al., 2010), plasma immersion ion implantation etching (Xia et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2012), metal-nanoparticle-assisted etching (Yuan et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2011), and laser-induced etching (Shen et al., 2004). Among these methods, the metal-nanoparticle-assisted etching is proved to be an effective fabrication technique and widely adopted for texturing large area Si wafers, in virtue of its low cost and easy processing for large area solar cells. Unfortunately, the efficiency of b-Si solar cells still falls behind that of the conventional crystalline silicon solar cells, mainly due to the enhanced surface recombination and Auger recombination in nanostructured silicon solar cells (Oh et al., 2012). Great efforts have been made to obtain high efficiency b-Si solar cells by controlling the size of silicon nanostructures (Yuan et al., 2009; Toor et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013) and using various passivation materials, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiNx:H) and Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), etc (Toor et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013) are used. It should be noted that these methods only work on controlling surface recombination, however, high Auger recombination caused by the high doping concentration related to in-diffusion through the large surface area of the silicon nanowires (SiNWs), also greatly limits the photogenerated carriers collection and influences cell efficiency. In this paper, b-Si wafers with SiNWs surface based on silver nanoparticle-assisted-etching are prepared. In order to reduce the recombination at and near the surface in SiNWs while maintaining good light trapping properties, we propose here an effective method of etching by using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) after the process of in-diffusion. Through the process of TMAH etching, surface recombination and Auger recombination at and near the surface of b-Si solar cells were dramatically suppressed, which was confirmed through the measurements of the effective carrier lifetime and the emitter saturation current density of the b-Si solar cells. The improvement of the carrier recombination lifetime greatly increased open circuit voltage (V oc) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) at short wavelength region, which leads to an excellent conversion efficiency for b-Si solar cells on large area (156\u00d7156mm2). 2 Experimental details We perform alkaline etch and then a two-step etch to create SiNWs structures on the as-prepared pyramid-structured silicon surfaces. P-type<100>unpolished monocrystalline silicon wafers with resistivity of 1\u20133\u03a9cm, area of 156\u00d7156mm2 and thickness of 250\u00b120\u03bcm were used in experiment. Before etching, the wafers were immersed in 10% HF for 1min to remove the native oxide and then rinsed in deionized water. The cleaned wafers were textured in KOH (2wt%) solution and IPA at 80\u00b0C for 30min to form pyramid-structures. During the process of black silicon etching, two kinds of mixed solution, labeled as I and II respectively, were used. Solution I: 0.001mol/L AgNO3 and 0.8vol% HF. Solution II: 6vol% HF and 1.4vol% H2O2. The process of black silicon etching can be summarized in the following two steps. First, a thin silver nanoparticle layer was deposited on the textured silicon surface in chemical solutions I. Then, the Ag nanoparticles covered Si wafers were subsequently immersed in solution II at room temperature to form nanowires on the pyramid-structures. To remove the Ag layer completely, the as-prepared samples were treated in a conventional Ag etchant solution consisting of NH4OH:H2O2: DI in the ratio of 1:1:5 in volume. At last, the samples were rinsed with DI water and dried with pure N2. For the solar cell preparation, n-type emitter was formed by phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) diffusion at the temperature of 845\u00b0C. The emitter sheet resistance is around 50\u03a9/\u25a1. A diluted HF solution was used to remove the phosphor silicate glass (PSG) layer. The diffused wafers were split into two groups, one group was kept as a reference, and the other was etched in a 0.1vol% TMAH resolution for 120s at room temperature. Through this process, the emitter sheet resistance increased to about 72\u03a9/\u25a1. A SiO2 thermal oxidation film formed at 850\u00b0C for 15min was then used to passivate the wafer surfaces of the two groups. After edge isolation, the wafers went through the Al back-surface-field formation, front and back electrodes screen-printing, and electrode metallization. The two groups of b-Si solar cells, without and with TMAH etch treatment were respectively labeled as B1 and B2. The morphology of the silicon nanowire structures was observed by a field effect scanning electron microscope (FESEM) on HITACHI S-4800. The effective carrier lifetime and emitter saturation current density of the b-Si solar cells were measured using quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) instrument on Sinton WCT-120. Optical reflectance of the b-Si wafers were detected using a spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of b-Si solar cells were measured by quantum efficiency measuring system. The dopant concentration profile of diffused b-Si wafers was measured by electrochemical capacitance voltage (CVP21). The electrical performances of b-Si solar cells were characterized using illuminated current\u2013voltage under one sun global spectrum of AM1.5. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 compares the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the front surface for the group B1 (Fig. 1(a)) and group B2 (Fig. 1(b)), respectively. We observe that the length of SiNWs is about 250nm and the average distance between two nearest SiNWs ranges from 50 to 100nm, as is shown in Fig. 1(a). Here we introduce a surface area enhancement ratio AF /A, where AF and A stand for the area of a nanostructured front surface of b-Si wafer and a pyramid-structured silicon wafer, respectively. The silicon nanowires were considered as cylinders, and the lateral area of the cylinders (As ) can be estimated by the average diameter and length observed from the SEM image. The surface area enhancement ratio can be estimated by AF /A =(AS + A)/A. This estimation method has also been used previously (Lin et al., 2013). From Fig. 1(a), the AF /A for the group B1 is calculated to be 3.4. After TMAH treatment, the spacing distance between two SiNWs is shorten to be about 150nm and the average length of SiNWs is shorten to be about 150nm, as is shown in Fig. 1b. Accordingly, the AF /A value of the group B2 decrease to 2.8. Fig. 2 presents the optical reflectance of b-Si wafers measured over the wavelength range from 350nm to 1100nm. The spectrum-weighted average reflectance is defined as (Menna et al., 1995): (1) R ave = \u222b 350 1100 R ( \u03bb ) N ( \u03bb ) d \u03bb \u222b 350 1100 N ( \u03bb ) where R(\u03bb) \u2013 total reflectance, N(\u03bb) \u2013 the solar flux under AM 1.5 standard conditions. The spectrum-weighted average reflectance of the group B1 and group B2 is calculated to be 2.38% and 2.71%, respectively. The slight increase in the reflectance of the group B1 results from the size modification of SiNWs by TMAH etching. The TMAH etch treatment also changes the doping concentration in emitter region of the b-Si solar cells. To verify it, we measured the doping concentration as a function of depth of emitter by ECV measurements, as is shown in Fig. 3 . Through the process of TMAH etching, the nanostructured surface peak doping concentration of the b-Si decreased to 7.05\u00d71020 cm\u22123 from 1.12\u00d71021 cm\u22123. The depth of the heavy doping concentration (>1020 cm\u22123) was shorten after the etching, which may depress the carrier Auger recombination of diffusion emitter for the group B2 cell. We also measured the effective carrier lifetime (\u03c4 eff) and the emitter saturation current density (J oe) in order to study the influence of TMAH etching on the b-Si solar cells, as is shown in Fig 4 . The b-Si samples with double sides diffused were used in the measurements of effective carrier lifetime. The emitter saturation current density was obtained by the analysis and calculation of the measured carrier lifetime. The emitter saturation current at the front and the back surfaces characterize the recombination of the front and the back diffusion regions respectively. In silicon with diffused emitter, effective minority carrier lifetime could be expressed as (Mankad et al., 2013) (2) 1 \u03c4 eff - 1 \u03c4 Auger = 1 \u03c4 bulk + J oe ( front ) + J oe ( back ) ( N A + \u0394 n ) qn i 2 d where \u03c4 bulk is the bulk Shockley\u2013Read\u2013Hall (SRH) lifetime, \u03c4 Auger is the bulk Auger lifetime, J oe(front) and J oe(back) are the emitter saturation current density at the front surface and back surface, respectively, NA is the bulk doping concentration of the wafer, \u0394n is the excess carrier concentration, and d is the wafer thickness. The \u03c4 eff of the group B1 and group B2 are 10.7\u03bcs and 20.8\u03bcs at injection carrier concentration \u0394n =1015 cm\u22123, respectively. An effective lifetime increase of 10.1\u03bcs of the group B2 is obtained, which may results from the suppressing of carrier recombination at the emitter region. To prove the supposition, the emitter saturation current density of the group B1 and group B2 was measured. The total emitter saturation current density J oe equals to the sum of J oe(front) and J oe(back). The emitter recombination term has a different dependence on the carrier injection than the bulk and surface recombination terms, allows determination of the J oe by examining the injection level of lifetime, particularly in the high injection regime (\u0394n > NA ). The bulk Auger recombination due to photogenerated minority carrier at high injection levels, the second term on the left, is a function of carrier density (King et al., 1990) and can be substracted out at a given carrier density. The emitter saturation current density can be given by the slope of the line (1/\u03c4 eff \u22121/\u03c4 Auger\u223c\u0394n), as shown in Fig. 4(b). The J oe of the group B2 decreases to 8.64\u00d710\u221213 A/cm2 from 2.12\u00d710\u221212 A/cm2 compared with that of the group B1, which improves the carrier lifetime in emitter region and leads to an increase of \u03c4 eff of b-Si wafers. As is well known, the performance of the carrier recombination of the crystalline silicon solar cells at emitter region is influenced by the surface recombination and the emitter Auger recombination. Through the process of TMAH etching, the surface area of the b-Si wafer is reduced, which suppresses the carrier surface recombination and raises the \u03c4 eff. In order to characterize the carriers recombination in emitter region, effective surface recombination velocity (S eff) (Kerr, 2002) was introduced in the following calculation. Emitter recombination can be viewed as a special case of surface recombination. A virtual surface can be defined just at the base side of the space-charge region and an effective surface recombination velocity expressed for the virtual surface (Kerr, 2002) (3) S eff = J oe N A + \u0394 n qn i 2 S eff is the sum of the effective surface recombination velocity at the front (SF eff) and the back surface (SB eff). The mechanisms of carrier recombination at and near the surface of solar cells could include recombination through surface states and Auger recombination in the heaviest doped parts of the emitter very near the nanostructured surface. It is hard to differentiate the surface recombination from the Auger recombination. In order to eliminate the effect of the surface area increase of the nanostructures, we induced SF loc (Oh et al., 2012) (4) S eff F = S loc F A F / A where SF loc is the local effective surface recombination velocity at and very near the actual front surface. SF eff is found to be liner with surface area enhancement ratio, which indicates that SF loc is independent of the scale of the silicon nanostructures (Lin et al., 2013; Oh et al., 2012). In the case of similar surface states, the change of SF loc is mainly induced by the Auger recombination at and near the emitter surface. The values of SF loc for the group B1 and the group B2 are 402\u00b1100cm/s and 189\u00b1100cm/s at carrier injection level \u0394n =1015 cm\u22123, respectively, which reveals that the Auger recombination in emitter region was dramatically suppressed through TMAH etch treatment. This improvement can be explained with the decrease of surface peak doping concentration and the shrink of the high doping concentration region (ND >1020 cm\u22123) in the emitter of the b-Si solar cell via the process of TMAH etch, as is shown in Fig 3. The illuminated current\u2013voltage characteristics of the group B1 and the group B2 were measured and the electrical properties are listed in Table 1 . The conversion efficiency (\u03b7) of the group B1 is found to be 16.9%, with an open circuit voltage (V oc) of 0.622V and a short circuit current density (J sc) of 35.10mA/cm2, as is shown in Table 1. Through the process of TMAH etching, the \u03b7 of the group B1 increased to 17.3%. The suppressed emitter carrier recombination of the group B1 could be responsible for the increase of the \u03b7, which makes a great increase of V oc by 7mV for the group B2 compared with the case of the group B1. An increment of 0.33% in reflectance for the group B2 leads to a slight reduction of 0.01mA/cm2 in J sc. However, it is a small loss compared with the beneficial impact of the improvement of the emitter carrier recombination lifetime. In order to further investigate the positive influence of electrical properties of b-Si solar cell via TMAH etch treatment, the IQE measurement was carried on, and the IQE curve is shown in Fig 5 . The total IQE is a sum of the contributions of the separate parts (Yang et al., 2008) (5) IQE = IQE e + IQE scr + IQE b where IQEe, IQEscr and IQEb denote the contributions of the emitter, the space charge region and the base to the total IQE, respectively. For photons with higher energy (350\u2013450nm), the IQEe dominates the IQE, which results from most of these photons were absorbed at the emitter region. The ratio of IQE spectra for the group B2 to the group B1in Fig. 5(b) shows that the IQE between the wavelength of 350\u2013600nm is enhanced, especially for the IQE between 350 and 450nm, which is increased by a factor of about 1.2. The better blue response of the group B2 proves that TMAH etch treatment can dramatically suppress the emitter carrier recombination. 4 Conclusion In summary, we demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of the large b-Si solar cells can be increased by surface modification through the process of TMAH etching. Two groups of b-Si wafers with SiNWs surface were processed by silver-nanoparticle-assisted etching. After the formation of the diffusion emitter, one group of the samples which was etched by TMAH for 120s have a slight increase of 0.39% in reflectance compared with the cell without TMAH etch treatment. The surface carrier recombination and the emitter Auger carrier recombination of the b-Si solar cells were suppressed by decreasing the surface area and the emitter surface doping concentration via TMAH etch treatment, which dramatically enhanced the short wavelength IQE and the open current circuit voltage of the b-Si solar cell. The effective carrier lifetime increases from 10.7\u03bcs to 20.8\u03bcs by TMAH etch treatment. By suppressing the emitter carrier recombination, a 17.3% efficient large area (156\u00d7156mm2) b-Si solar cell without any vacuum deposited dielectric antireflection coating was achieved.
