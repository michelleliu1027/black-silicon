In this contribution, we present our recent results for high efficiency multicrystalline silicon solar cells. Based on n-type high-performance multicrystalline silicon substrates in combination with the TOPCon solar cell concept featuring a full area passivating back contact and a boron-diffused emitter as well as a plasma-etched black-silicon texture at the front side, a certified conversion efficiency of 22.3% has been achieved, which is currently the world record efficiency for multicrystalline silicon solar cells. A detailed loss analysis of the record solar cell batch discloses the nature of the remaining loss mechanisms, revealing the route for further improvements. We observe an efficiency gap between the multicrystalline and the FZ reference solar cells of ~1%abs. Compared to the FZ reference cells, the mc-Si cells also feature a significantly larger scattering in Voc and Jsc as well as a fill factor loss of ~1.5%abs. We show that the scattering in Jsc correlates with the area fraction of recombination-active structural crystal defects and the scattering in Voc additionally with lateral emitter-induced inhomogeneities. The fill factor loss is attributed to the general presence of strongly recombination-active grain boundaries. A detailed loss analysis of the record mc-Si solar cell shows that the major electrical losses are due to recombination at grain boundaries (0.7%abs) and recombination in the emitter (0.6%abs). By reducing these electrical loss channels, e.g. by an improved crystallization process together with a hydrogenation of the bulk and application of an adapted emitter, we expect to reach efficiencies for mc-Si solar cells in the range of 23%. Keywords Multicrystalline silicon N-type Free energy loss analysis TOPCon Record efficiency 1 Introduction In the past years, research on n-type multicrystalline silicon revealed its large solar cell efficiency potential. The availability of an excellent and robust n-type solar cell process featuring a tunnel-oxide passivating back contact (TOPCon) [1] and the continuously improved material quality of the n-type high-performance multicrystalline silicon (HP mc-Si) are the two key features for highest mc-Si efficiencies. The optimization of the n-type HP mc-Si material with regard to the TOPCon cell concept by improvements of the crystal structure and optimization of the base resistivity together with an improved light trapping by application of a black-silicon plasma process for front side texturing enabled the fabrication of an n-type HP mc-Si solar cell with 21.9% efficiency [2,3]. Recently, this value was exceeded by an HP mc-Si TOPCon solar cell with a certified conversion efficiency of 22.3%, which is the current world record for multicrystalline silicon solar cells. The already high level and the steady and fast improvement of these efficiencies reflect the large potential of HP mc-Si TOPCon solar cells. But this record efficiency is still ~1%abs below the efficiency of reference cells on FZ material. Therefore, we perform a thorough loss analysis of the recent solar cell batches in order to explore the remaining limitations and identify options to overcome these. This enables us to further adapt both the crystallization process as well as the solar cell processing to push multicrystalline silicon to its limits, which are by far not reached yet. 2 Material fabrication The n-type HP mc-Si used in this work has been developed at Fraunhofer ISE. The G2 size research ingots (equivalent to 75\u202fkg of pure polysilicon feedstock) were crystallized by the directional solidification method with seeded growth. High-purity silicon granules from a Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) process were used as seed material and were placed in the bottom of a high-purity fused-silica crucible. As dopant material silicon wafers enriched with phosphorus (1085 ppmw) were used. The crystallization resulted in a resistivity profile from 1.5\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm above the remaining seed material to 0.5\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm at the ingot top. A brick with 156\u202fmm side length was cut from the ingot center. After cropping of 15\u202fmm at bottom and top, the brick was processed into wafers with a thickness of 195\u202f\u00b5m by multiwire sawing with SiC slurry and structured wire. 3 Solar cell and lifetime sample processing HP mc-Si solar cell processing included the fabrication of multicrystalline solar cells as well as monocrystalline FZ reference cells. The fabricated mc-Si solar cells are sketched by the cross-section shown in Fig. 1. The details of the standard cell fabrication process applied in the first solar cell batch, which includes a BBr3 diffusion (~90\u202f\u03a9/sq) and a high-temperature TOPCon anneal, can be found in [3]. In the second cell processing batch, we included one group with the standard fabrication process and additionally investigated the improvement potential of a P-gettering step and an optimization of the emitter diffusion temperature (875\u202f\u00b0C, ~140\u202f\u03a9/sq) with and without a \u201cdrive-in\u201d oxidation in 5 other groups. In order to investigate the impact of the boron emitter on solar cell performance in more detail, in a further experiment HP mc-Si wafers were processed to planar solar cell precursors (featuring a TOPCon layer on the rear side and a boron emitter passivated by a stack of Al2O3 and SiNx on the front side, in the following referred to as \u201cemitter lifetime samples\u201d). These emitter lifetime samples were investigated by injection-dependent photoluminescence (PL) lifetime imaging [4]. After characterization, the passivating layers and the emitter were etched back and the silicon bulk was surface passivated by SiNx on both sides in order to obtain bulk lifetime samples, which were also characterized by injection-dependent PL lifetime imaging. 4 Solar cell results Fig. 2 shows solar cell parameters of all HP mc-Si solar cells of the first [2,3] and the second cell batch in comparison to the corresponding FZ reference cells. The insets in the efficiency graph show PL images of the record mc-Si solar cells of each batch. In the second batch, both the maximum efficiencies as well as their scattering are significantly improved for the mc-Si solar cells. The increase in efficiency is mainly attributed to an increase in J sc, while the narrower efficiency distribution is based on less scattering in the fill factor. Note that in Fig. 2, we do not distinguish between the different groups of batch 2, because no clear dependence of the specific high-temperature process sequences on the efficiency was observed. The P-gettering step did not show a significant performance improvement, probably because the bulk quality is already high after the boron diffusion and the grain boundary recombination is not significantly reduced by the P-diffusion (see also Section 5.4). The optimized emitter diffusion temperature led to a slight increase in J sc, which was compensated by a slight reduction in the fill factor. It is noteworthy that nearly all mc-Si solar cells of the second batch feature efficiencies above 21%, 11 of which even above 22%. Still, we observe a gap between the best mc-Si solar cells and the best reference cells of 1%abs, which is equally related to losses in J sc, FF and V oc. Additionally, the mc-Si cells feature a larger efficiency scattering compared to the FZ reference cells. Both, the origins of the lower absolute values as well as the larger scattering will be addressed in detail in the next section. The cell parameters of the record mc-Si solar cell which were confirmed by Fraunhofer ISE CalLab are reported in Table 1. 5 Loss analysis In this section, the mc-Si specific losses are analyzed in detail, separated by cell parameters, before a free energy loss analysis of the record mc-Si solar cell is performed. The combination of the statistical analysis of the solar cell batches and the detailed analysis for the record cell leads to a coherent understanding of the remaining losses in multicrystalline silicon TOPCon solar cells and delivers guidelines for further improvements. 5.1 J sc The most prominent difference between mono- and multicrystalline silicon is the presence of structural crystal defects such as grain boundaries in multicrystalline material. Especially in high-performance mc-Si, recombination-active grain boundaries have been identified to account for the majority of material-related losses [2,5]. In order to quantify the area fraction of such defects, we evaluated PL images of the mc-Si solar cells and assigned pixels with an intensity below a certain threshold value to recombination-active structural crystal defects (RASCD). Thus, grain areas can be distinguished from areas affected by recombination-active grain boundaries, sub-grain boundaries or dislocations and correlations of the cell parameters with the structural crystal quality can be identified. Please note that RASCD are mainly line-shaped structures (in top view) and the measurement of the affected cell-area fraction depends on the lateral diffusion of charge carriers, the imaging resolution, and the threshold value. Nevertheless, this method turned out to be quite robust for the setup used in this work (1 sun illumination, 65 pixel/cm). The procedure is illustrated for the record cell of batch 1 in Fig. 3a, where the red areas in the PL-image are accounted for as RASCD, which relates to an area fraction of ~ 9% in this case. Fig. 3a shows a linear decrease in J sc with increasing area fraction of RASCD. Please note that this graph shows the results for cell batch 1. Similar results are obtained for batch 2, notably the record cell of batch 2 with ~ 6% area fraction of RASCD (cf. insets in Fig. 2) that correlates to the J SC of 41.1 mA/cm2. Thus, the losses in J sc of the mc-Si solar cells compared to the FZ reference cells are fully related to recombination-active structural crystal defects. 5.2 V oc In general, also V oc decreases with increasing area fraction of RASCD. However, here the trend is less pronounced than in the case of J sc (cf. Fig. 3b). In order to understand this additional scattering, we investigated emitter and bulk lifetime samples. Fig. 4 shows lifetime images of the same sample with and without emitter at high and low level injection (illumination intensity ~ 1 sun and 1/30 sun). While the bulk lifetime sample features relatively homogeneous inner grain lifetimes (cf. upper row in Fig. 4), strong lateral variations in the inner grain lifetimes are observed for the emitter lifetime sample (cf. lower row in Fig. 4). Thus, the additional scattering cannot be explained by pure bulk recombination, but by lateral inhomogeneities specifically occurring on the emitter lifetime sample. It should be noted that the emitter lifetime sample featured a TOPCon rear side passivation. A grain-orientation dependent passivation quality of the TOPCon layer could be excluded by spatially-resolved and injection-dependent lifetime measurements on bulk lifetime samples passivated with TOPCon layers on both sides. This has also been shown in [6]. Thus, we attribute the lateral inhomogeneities on the emitter lifetime samples to the presence of a boron emitter on the n-type mc-Si base. Two effects need to be separated here: At low injection levels, the charge carrier densities and lifetimes are dominated by lateral transport effects. Highest lifetimes and \u0394n are obtained in areas far away from strong recombination centers, e.g. in the center of large grains. Smaller grains are already significantly affected by carrier diffusion to neighboring RASCD and, thus, feature lower \u0394n as well as lower effective lifetimes (cf. Fig. 4 lower left). At higher injection levels, however, a second effect not related to lateral charge carrier transport seems to set in. At an illumination intensity of ~ 1 sun, significant differences in inner grain lifetimes are observed for the emitter lifetime sample (cf. Fig. 4 lower right). A closer look at the injection-dependent lifetime in several grains of the emitter and the bulk lifetime sample delivers further insights into this additional inhomogeneity induced by the presence of an emitter on the n-type HP mc-Si bulk (cf. Fig. 5). While the different grains feature a virtually identical bulk lifetime on a high level (open symbols in Fig. 5), the lifetime of the emitter samples features strong lateral variations from grain to grain. While the decreasing lifetime towards low injection levels for the emitter samples is due to the lateral carrier transport to RASCD mentioned above (see also Section 5.3), the curves also reveal a variation in maximum lifetime at higher injection levels. We attribute the RASCD-independent additional scattering in V oc to this inhomogeneity, which indicates a lateral variation in J 01,e. For comparison, the impact of a J 01,e of 30 fA/cm2 (typical value for the reference solar cells) and 70 fA/cm2 (used in the simulations for the record mc-Si cell in Section 5.3) on the inner grain bulk lifetime is also shown in Fig. 5. This illustrates that even the best grains (grain 3 in Fig. 5) cannot be described by a J 01,e of 30 fA/cm2, whereas a value of 70 fA/cm2 seems to be an approximate average for the mc-Si material. The origin of the lateral variation of the effective lifetime in the emitter samples is not yet understood and currently under investigation. Possible reasons could be a variation in the emitter profile due to different diffusion coefficients of B depending on either the crystal orientation of the grains or a different defect density within the grains. It has been shown by Bentzen et. al [7] that phosphorus diffusion can be significantly enhanced along in-grain crystallographic defects, which might also be the case for boron diffusions and directly lead to a different J 01,e. If not directly, different emitter profiles could indirectly affect the effective lifetime by an interaction with impurities in the material that are only weakly recombination-active in the n-type bulk, but significantly contribute to recombination in the p-type emitter. However, these hypotheses have to be investigated by further experiments on grain-dependent profiles and measurements of inner grain defect densities. 5.3 FF Finally, we observe a significantly lower FF of the mc cells compared to the FZ references of around 1.5%abs, even for the record solar cell. The loss is substantially beyond what is expected due to the slightly lower V oc, and is not related to metal grid losses as confirmed by pFF measurements. Notably, the loss cannot be replicated in our ELBA simulations which consider the macroscopic spatial inhomogeneity and injection-dependence of the bulk lifetime as measured by injection-dependent lifetime imaging. In the following we test different hypothesis causing this FF loss. 5.4 Macroscopic inhomogeneity of the bulk lifetime It can be doubted that distributed transport effects are fully accounted for within our previous ELBA simulations due to the approximation of independent simulations per pixel being averaged. We therefore use Quokka3 [8] to simulate a quarter of the cell in 3D including the spatial- and injection-dependent lifetime images, not imposing such simplifications, see Fig. 6. However, with these full 3D simulations we neither found a significant difference in global IV characteristics to the ELBA simulations, nor to assuming an average spatially homogenous (but still injection-dependent) lifetime curve within the same Quokka3 model. This means that the macroscopic distributed nature of the bulk lifetime does not produce any noticeable nonlinear losses beyond what is included in the spatially averaged lifetime, which is consistent with previous similar investigations [9], and thus cannot explain the observed FF loss. 5.4.1 Perimeter losses It is well known that perimeter losses can be significant for such small-size in-wafer high efficiency cells, manifesting mainly as a FF loss [10\u201312]. We use Quokka3 to simulate the full-cell geometry with and without the perimeter and are thereby able to quantify the perimeter losses. The losses are very low (see Section 5.4), and not different between FZ and mc material, and are therefore ruled out to cause the observed FF loss. 5.4.2 Explicit grain boundary modelling Typically, as also in our previous works, the inhomogeneity of recombination in mc-Si is considered via imaging the macroscopic lifetime variations. Imaging unavoidably reduces the \u201csharpness\u201d of the grain boundary recombination at least by integrating over the camera's pixel size, and additionally by electrical and optical smearing effects which cannot be entirely avoided or corrected. Subsequent simulations using such measurements as inputs consequently represent only an approximation of the real physical effects happening. To test whether an explicit consideration of the grain boundary within the modelling can better replicate the experimental observations, we set up a 2D domain in Quokka3 (cf. Fig. 7) representing a single grain with a good \u201cinner\u201d lifetime of ~2 ms (measured), similar as in [13\u201315]. Different to those previous publications we do not attempt to model the detailed physics of recombination at the grain boundary. Instead, we approximate it by an effective surface recombination velocity S eff and emphasize the effect on IV parameters and effective lifetime for changing grain size and S eff, which is shown in Fig. 8. The only other unknown within the otherwise well calibrated cell model is the J 01,e, as there is evidence for additional losses compared to the FZ references. It is set to 70 fA/cm2, as this value results in best overall agreement with the various experimental data, see also Section 5.2. In Fig. 8a the simulated FF and V oc are plotted for the typical \u201chomogenous\u201d simulation approach, which uses an (injection-dependent) bulk lifetime derived from averaging the respective bulk lifetime images, as well as for the explicit grain boundary simulations. The homogenous simulation approach cannot replicate the measured FF, whereas the grain boundary simulations can manifest either as a FF or V oc loss, depending on grain size. Simulations with a value of S eff = 20,000 cm/s are able to approximately explain i) the IV-parameters of the record cell with a grain size of 10 mm as estimated from PL images, and ii) the effective lifetime of a well passivated mc-Si wafer (without emitter diffusion) which has an average grain size in the order of millimeters, see Fig. 8b. The missing injection dependence of the simulated lifetime is likely caused by neglecting the injection-dependence of the inner-grain bulk-lifetime or of the grain boundary recombination. It is an interesting finding in turn that the non-ideality manifesting within the simulation as a FF loss is not visible in the corresponding lifetime-curve when no emitter is present, explaining why the FF loss cannot be replicated when using the effective injection-dependent lifetime (images) of wafers without emitter diffusion within the typical simulation approach. As only the explicit modelling of grain boundary recombination is able to consistently explain the FF losses, the cell IV parameters and the spatial variation of lifetime images, we suggest to have identified and quantified an important loss mechanism previously not considered in cell-level analyses of mc-Si cells. The loss manifests in particular for the case of good intra-grain quality, relatively large grain sizes and high overall cell performance, and thus became visible only due to the recent advances in cell performance and accuracy of characterization. For other cases, it manifests mainly as a V oc loss, which will then be correctly included by an analysis based on macroscopic lifetime distribution. We note that what appears and was discussed as a \u201cJ 02-loss\u201d (non-ideal recombination) on cell level [16], can be entirely replicated by assuming only ideal recombination properties with a strong lateral variation across the cell. 5.4.3 Free energy loss analysis for record mc-Si solar cell To quantify the influence of the different loss mechanisms, we use the free energy loss analysis (FELA) [17], enhanced by including optical losses via multiplying the respective loss current density with the maximum power voltage. Not all loss mechanisms are captured within a single simulation, as it is practically impossible to setup a full-area 3D simulation resolving grain boundaries as vertically recombinative planes, which we found in the previous section to be necessary to explain the FF losses. We thus use i) a full-cell Quokka3 model of the record cell to determine mainly perimeter losses, metal grid resistance losses and optical losses, see Fig. 6, and ii) the detailed grain boundary simulations calibrated to the record cell to breakdown in particular the recombination losses. In Fig. 9 it can be seen that optics are a major loss channel. They are however not related to the mc-material, and being similar to our record FZ cells approaching conversion efficiencies of 26% [12], are close to what is practically achievable. The material-related losses are dominated by emitter recombination and grain boundary recombination, whereas the inner-grain SRH recombination is not a substantial loss mechanism anymore. This might also explain why an additional P-gettering after the boron emitter diffusion does not lead to a significant performance improvement of the solar cells (see Section 4), if it does not efficiently reduce grain boundary recombination. As described in the previous sections, the loss due to grain boundary recombination is to a substantial part caused by the presence of the emitter. Thus, a more detailed investigation and improvement of the emitter technology and its interplay with grain boundaries is a promising key to further improve mc-Si cell efficiencies. 6 Summary and outlook In this work we presented a detailed loss analysis of our record mc-Si TOPCon solar cells, which explains the observed differences compared with FZ reference cells for the IV parameters. While an increased area fraction of recombination-active structural crystal defects explains the losses in J sc, it only partly explains the losses in V oc, which is additionally affected by lateral inhomogeneities induced by the presence of an emitter on the n-type HP mc-Si bulk. The origin of this effect is under investigation. Finally, we showed that the lower fill factors in the mc-Si material can be completely understood by enhanced grain boundary recombination in combination with very high inner grain lifetimes assuming only ideal recombination properties, which is in contrast to previous speculations about a non-ideal recombination related to the multicrystalline material. Thus, this apparent non-ideality is an effect of extreme differences in recombination activity occurring in one cell, as it is the case for HP mc-Si material with high inner-grain lifetimes and still strongly recombination-active grain boundaries. The loss analysis of the record mc-Si solar cell showed that the major electrical losses are due to recombination at grain boundaries (0.7%abs) and recombination in the emitter (0.6%abs). Current work focuses on the reduction of these loss channels, especially by reducing the area fraction and recombination activity of grain boundaries by improving the crystallization process and including a hydrogenation of the bulk, as well as an optimization of the boron emitter. Thus, we are optimistic to reach mc-Si efficiencies in the range of 23%. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank P. H\u00e4uber, F. Haas, F. Sch\u00e4tzle, A. Leimenstoll, S. Seitz, N.
