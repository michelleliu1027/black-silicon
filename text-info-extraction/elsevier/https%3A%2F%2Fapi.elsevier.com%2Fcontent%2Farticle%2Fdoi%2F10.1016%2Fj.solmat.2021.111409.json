Optical loss is a significant factor restricting the conversion efficiency of conventional bifacial tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells. Black silicon structure is commonly used to enhance the photogenerated current density (J ph) of crystalline solar cells due to its excellent light-trapping capability. However, the photogenerated current gain is cancelled by the increased emitter recombination current originated from the black silicon structure with a high enhanced surface area ratio. In this work, we used a buffered oxide etching solution to modify the surface morphology of nanopore/micron-pyramid composite (NPP) structure silicon. Further, we studied the effects of NPP structures with different enhanced surface area ratio on front-side reflection, boron atom doping, emitter passivation, and cell performance. By identifying the appropriate surface modification processing, we fabricated the large-scale (158.75 mm \u00d7 158.75 mm) bifacial TOPCon solar cells using industrial equipment and processes with an average short-circuit current density of 41.12 mA/cm2 and average conversion efficiency of 23.08%. Through adequately widening nanostructure size and depositing high-quality Al2O3/SiNx stacked passivation films on NPP structure surface, we achieved lower carrier recombination while maintaining high J ph. Keywords Optical loss Nanopore/micron-pyramid TOPCon Surface modification 1 Introduction In recent years, the passivated emitter and rear solar cells (PERC) with a median efficiency of 22% have been widely incorporated into large volume photovoltaic (PV) module productions in the PV manufacturing mainstream [1]. However, the losses of metal-silicon contact recombination and three-dimensional current transport limit the conversion efficiency of PERC solar cells. Therefore, researchers put forward and developed a tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) technology, which has been proven by laboratory solar cells to achieve an efficiency of about 26% [2,3]. TOPCon structure features an ultra-thin silicon oxide (SiOx) layer and a heavily doped polysilicon layer, providing excellent full-area back passivation and carrier collection probability. In TOPCon structure, the interfacial oxide layer isolates metal-silicon contact and lessens interface defect states. The heavily doped polysilicon layer provides favorable band alignment for carrier extraction based on quantum tunneling mechanism [4]. The TOPCon solar cells have achieved an open-circuit voltage (V oc) greater than 720 mV and a rear saturation current density (J 0, rear) less than 3 fA/cm2 [5,6]. Nevertheless, the optical loss still accounts for a large part of TOPCon conversion efficiency loss. This mainly composed of three aspects: (1) the front-side reflection loss caused by conventional micron-pyramid texture; (2) the parasitic absorption caused by heavily doped polysilicon and anti-reflection (AR) layers; (3) the inevitable metal gridline shielding [7\u20139]. Preparing advanced light-trapping texture is essential to enhance the utilization of available solar spectrum and obtain a high photogenerated current density for crystalline silicon solar cells. Black silicon (b-Si), also known as nanostructured surface silicon [10], has stimulated worldwide research interests, which effectively strengthens light absorption [11], and lessens metal-silicon contact resistivity [12]. In addition, for solar cells that generate electricity all-weather, it is very attractive that b-Si structure exhibits a remarkable omnidirectional light-trapping capability under the various illumination angles from 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 [13]. In many attempts to integrate b-Si structures with various solar cells, they are categorized as pure nanostructure texture [10,14\u201318] and nano-micron composite structure texture [19\u201321] according to size and geometric characteristic. Noteworthy, the pure nanostructure texture requires long length (micrometre level) and high aspect ratio to achieve \u223c 2% or lower reflectance [22\u201324]. The concomitant disadvantages of increased surface recombination, high Auger recombination, and poor mechanical robustness hinder the photovoltaic application of pure nanostructure b-Si [25]. By contrast, the nano-micron composite structure used a texture-on-texture approach gets around many limitations of pure nanostructure texture. For example, it allows much smaller size feature nanostructures to achieve efficient light-trapping over broadband wavelength ranges [13], because of the combination of the internal light scattering absorption via the micron-sized texture and the coupling absorption between light and materials via the nano-sized texture. This is in turn easier to passivate interface defect, reduce surface doping concentration and improve mechanical robustness [13,26]. In previous works, there has been some progress in suppressing carrier recombination of b-Si, including optimizing surface morphology [16,27], regulating the height of nanostructures [28], depositing various dielectric passivation films [18,29\u201331], and reducing surface doping concentration [25,32]. Previous b-Si solar cells were limited to the traditional aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) structures [33], PERC [34], or interdigitated back-contact back-junction (IBC) structures [10]. In this paper, we have demonstrated high-efficiency b-Si bifacial TOPCon solar cells (>23%) on industry-sized (158.75 \u00d7 158.75 mm2) n-type silicon wafers. Here, the nano-micron composite b-Si structure was prepared by a texture-on-texture approach, specifically, creating silicon nanopore textures by reactive ion etching (RIE) on top of a pre-formed alkaline textured random micron-pyramid surface, named as NPP structure. RIE is widely used in developing and manufacturing semiconductor devices, particularly due to its anisotropy, high etching selectivity, and rapid etching speed [35]. Specifically, to find the optimal feature size of NPP structures, the diameter and depth of nanopores were controlled by using a buffered oxide etching (BOE) solution, and the effects on optical absorption and emitter passivation of NPP TOPCon solar cells were studied in detail. Meanwhile, to obtain a lower surface recombination rate, atomic layer deposition (ALD) aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layers superimposed with plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon nitride (SiNx) layers are used to passivate NPP surface. This work highlights the significant benefits of NPP structures for solar cells after proper pore-widen modification compared with the micron-pyramid alone, and discusses the electrical and optical root causes behind the observed improvements. The proposed method is mass-production compatible with the existing solar cell production lines, opening a potential prospect for the large-scale production of high-efficiency nanostructured silicon solar cells. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Fabrication The NPP TOPCon solar cell structure and process flow in this work are outlined in Fig. 1 . Industry-standard n-type (100) Czochralski-Si (c-Si) solar-grade wafers with 158 \u00d7 158 mm2 size, 1 \u03a9cm-resistivity, and 170 \u03bcm-thickness were used as substrates. The fabrication of NPP structures is different from conventional pure nanostructures starting from a planar silicon wafer. First, the cleaned wafers were immersed in an alkaline solution containing 1.1 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 6 wt% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min to remove the saw damage and create random micro-sized pyramids on wafer surface. Then, nanopores were fabricated using a maskless RIE system at room temperature in a mixed plasma of O2, Cl2 and SF6, 13.56 MHz radio-frequency platen power of 100 W. After that, the samples were immersed in a mixture BOE solution of ammonium fluoride (NH4\u00b7F), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and water (H2O) for times that varied from 60 s to 2400 s and were divided into five groups according to pore-widening time (P1 \u223c P5). The etching mechanisms of BOE solution on silicon wafers are shown in Formula (1), (2) and (3)\uff1a (1) 2 H 2 O 2 + S i \u2192 S i O 2 + 2 H 2 O (2) S i O 2 + 6 H F \u2192 H 2 S i F 6 + 2 H 2 O (3) N H 4 \u22c5 F + H 2 O \u2192 N H 3 \u22c5 H 2 O + H F To evaluate the application prospects of NPP emitter in TOPCon solar cells, optimized NPP structure wafers and random micron-pyramid structure wafers were subjected to the process flow as shown in Fig. 1a. The initial quantity of samples per group was 30. To form a boron-doped emitter, various textured samples were placed in one graphite boat with a diffusion at 860 \u00b0C followed by a drive-in process at 1000 \u00b0C using BBr3 source. After chemical cleaning rear boron diffusion using HF/HNO3 mixed solution, an ultrathin SiOx layer was grown in a thermal oxidation process and a 150-\u03bcm-thick intrinsic amorphous silicon layer was deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). In order to form the final TOPCon structure with n-doped polysilicon, phosphorus dopant was first introduced into the intrinsic amorphous silicon layer by ion implantation, and an annealing process afterwards in a tube furnace at 900 \u00b0C was applied to activate phosphorus atoms accompanied by a crystalline state transformation from amorphous to polycrystalline. After removing n-doped polysilicon covered on the front-side and edge by wet etching method, a rear SiNx film via PECVD was deposited on the back side to reinforce the passivation effect and bifacial power generation. To reduce emitter recombination rate and minimize reflection loss, a stacked 4-nm-thick ALD-Al2O3/75-nm-thick PECVD-SiNx layer was coated on various textured surfaces. Finally, a metallization pattern with 12 busbars was screen printed on double sides of all samples, and the followed ohmic contacts were formed by a fast co-sintered process. 2.2 Characterization The morphology and size of NPP structures were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the scale of 10.0 K magnifications and 30.0 k magnifications, respectively. The reflectance spectra from 300 to 1200 nm were determined by hemispherical reflectance spectrometry with an integrating sphere. The sheet resistance (R sheet) of the boron diffused silicon was measured by four-probes method before and after removing wrap around polysilicon. The distribution and concentration of electroactive boron atoms were measured by electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) profiling after removing wrap around polysilicon. To study the effect of NPP surface morphology on emitter passivation quality, the effective minority carrier lifetime (\u03c4 eff), saturation current density (J 0) and implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc) were extracted from the quasi-steady state photoconductance lifetime measurement data. Various textured samples for measuring the \u03c4 eff, J 0 and iV oc were randomly selected from the solar cells before forming metal contacts. Photoluminescence (PL) images of the lifetime monitor were also measured to reflect the passivation quality and uniformity. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were identified at solar cell spectral response measurement system. The valuable electrical parameters, including V oc, short-circuit current density (J sc), filling factor (FF), and photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), etc., were measured with an in-line, light I\u2013V and Suns-V oc measuring instrument (Sinton FCT-750). 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Surface morphology and optical property Firstly, we prepared five kinds of NPP structures with different nanostructure size and morphology through isotropic etching at different times (P1 < P2 < P3 < P4 < P5). Compared with random micron-pyramid texture prepared by wet chemically etching method in Fig. 2 a, the NPP structure is a superposition of densely packed nanopores and random micron-pyramids. The top-view SEM images in Fig. 2(b-f) clearly show the morphology evolution of NPP surface in different BOE cleaning times, and some nanopore diameters are marked in the local enlarged images. The zoom-in version of Fig. 2(b-f) demonstrates that with increased pore-widening time, the mean diameter of nanopores increases from 132 to 304 nm, and the depth of nanopores becomes shallow from 220 to 102 nm. As mentioned earlier, the acid oxidation etched on silicon wafer is isotropic, independent of the crystal orientation [36]. Furthermore, the yellow circles in Fig. 2 specifically show the morphology evolution of nanochannels among micron-pyramids. On the one hand, this is the same as the trend of nanopores with pore-widening time. On the other hand, deeper and wider nanochannels are formed between random micro-pyramids related to the RIE etching mechanism. The silicon etching process in RIE system combines the chemical reactions between reactive plasma and silicon substrates, as well as the physical effects of ion bombardment [35]. In RIE etching process, the V-shaped structures at random micron-pyramid intersection will be subjected to more physical bombardment and chemical etching of reactive ions [37]. To analyze the impact of nanostructure size feature on NPP TOPCon solar cells, we established a simplified geometric model based on the SEM results to count and calculate the NPP structural parameters. Supplement Figure. S1 shows the simplified schematic diagram of geometric structure model. Table 1 lists the mean nanopore diameter (D), nanopore depth (L), nanochannel width (W), nanochannel projection proportion (C), and the enhanced surface area ratio (A F/A proj) [14]. Here, A F represents the front surface area, A proj represents the corresponding projection area, A F/A proj is calculated by various geometric parameters to comprehensively evaluating the surface characteristics. In the subsequent discussion, we investigated the evolution of photoelectric performances as the function of A F/A proj. The light-trapping property of silicon wafers is essential for solar cells. For NPP textures with different A F/A proj, we measured the reflectance spectra from 300 to 1200 nm and calculated the average reflectance (R AVE) in Fig. 3 a, and compared the digital pictures taken vertically in different pore-widening time treatments in Fig. 3b. Firstly, the reflectance of NPP textures is obviously lower than that of conventional micron-pyramid texture in the wavelength range of 300\u20131050 nm, especially at shorter wavelengths (<400 nm). The strong AR effect of NPP textures originates from the introduction of nanopores and nanochannels, which effectively enhances the coupling between shortwave and silicon, and increases the optical transmission path in silicon [38]. Furthermore, the AR effect of NPP textures is not improved above a wavelength of 1050 nm, because most of this portion starts to transmit through the 170-\u03bcm-thick Si wafer, regardless of the front-side morphology [33]. Secondly, when A F/A proj decreased from 5.28 to 3.45, the R AVE of NPP textures increased from 9.92% to 12.73%, and the increased reflectance mainly covers the range of 300\u2013600 nm. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3b, the digital picture from the top-view of micron-pyramid surface appears gray, and the NPP surface without pore-widening treatment appears black. When the pore-widening time increases step by step, we can see that the color of NPP surface gradually becomes lighter and approaches gray, which confirms that decreased A F/A proj weakens the AR capability of NPP textures in the visible light spectra. Solar cell processing (e.g., boron diffusion and surface etch) and the addition of AR coatings will change the final texture that appears on solar cells, as will the optical properties. Therefore, we have added the reflectance spectra for the final AR coated version of various textures in Fig. 3c. As shown in Fig. 3c, due to the existence of AR coating, all reflectance spectra of the final cells have decreased significantly compared with bare silicon textures. For NPP TOPCon solar cells, the reflectance increased with A F/A proj in the short-wavelength range of 370\u2013650 nm, consistent with that for bare silicon textures. But the reflectance gap between different NPP cells is much smaller. In this work, to reduce the impact of AR coating process and equipment on thickness and refractive index of AR layer, all NPP samples and referenced micron-pyramid samples were placed in one graphite boat for PECVD SiNx films. Therefore, the difference in surface roughness and geometry allows the SiNx film thickness on our referenced micron-pyramid texture to be thicker than a typical SiNx film thickness (75\u201380 nm), up to \u223c 95 nm, because this coating process is optimized according to NPP textures. Such too thick AR coatings on micron-pyramid texture result in a reflectance higher than 10% at 400 nm and higher than 1% at 500 nm. In order to fairly compare the optical properties appeared on the final solar cells between NPP textures and conventional micron-pyramid textures, we selected the NPP texture (A F/A proj = 4.51) with the best photoelectric performance according to Table 2 and conventional micron-pyramid texture to optimize the SiNx film thickness, respectively. And their measurement results of reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 3d. First, NPP texture distinctly reduce reflectance of the device in short-wavelength range from 300 to 470 nm and mid-long wavelength range from 750 to 1050 nm. The reason is that NPP structures similar to shortwave size weaken the zero-order reflection intensity and capture more photons [39], as well as the existence of sub-micron size pores and channels increases the reflection and refraction times of light on the front-side, respectively. Secondly, TOPCon solar cells with either conventional micron-pyramid texture or NPP texture have strong optical absorption at the same level in the mid-wavelength range of 470\u2013750 nm. Compared with the reflectance spectra results of different A F/A proj wafers shown in Fig. 3a, the advantage of NPP texture in mid-wavelength light absorption is eliminated by the representative AR layers. This is mainly because the thickness and refractive index of the SiNx layers are designed to form effective destructive interference in the medium wavelength band, which greatly weakens the reflectance of the incident light. Notice that the structure and fabrication process on the back-side of NPP cells with different A F/A proj are the same as the baseline. When long-wavelength incident light passes through solar cells, it suffers from the same back reflection effect, so all solar cells show similar long-wavelength spectral response. 3.2 Emitter passivation properties The emitter doping properties, such as surface doping concentration (N s) and doping depth, are affected by surface morphology and high temperature process during boron diffusion, which further influence the Auger recombination and contact resistance of emitter [32,40]. The sheet resistance of boron-doped emitter (R sheet,p +) and boron concentration profiles as a function of A F/A proj provide a reference for analyzing the effect of surface morphology on the evolution of emitter passivation and electrical properties. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the R sheet,p + of NPP textures are lower than that of conventional micron-pyramid texture before and after removing wrap around polysilicon, which indicates that emitter texture with higher A F/A proj can intensify the boron doping concentration. But the variation trend of R sheet,p + is not linearly correlated with A F/A proj, the NPP emitter with a middle A F/A proj of 4.51 shows the largest R sheet,p + of 78.5 \u03a9/sq. In addition, the R sheet,p + of all samples increases slightly after removing wrap around polysilicon, which indicates that the etching solution has a slight etching effect on those textures. Since the etching solution etches the silicon wafer isotropically, the geometry of NPP structures is almost unchanged, but the nanostructure size may be slightly expanded. To understand the effect of NPP textures on boron diffusion, Fig. 4b shows the ECV curves of the doping concentration versus depth and the corresponding R sheet,p + of six A F/A proj. Notably, the conventional micron-pyramid texture with the smallest A F/A proj of 1.79 exhibited the lowest surface doping (N s \u223c 1.67 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123). The N s of NPP textures increased from \u223c2.1 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123 to \u223c2.54 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123 when A F/A proj increased from 3.45 to 5.28. In general, the NPP textures possess a higher N s and a deeper junction depth than micron-pyramid texture, and the N s increases with A F/A proj, which can be explained by the details of boron diffusion [41]. In the first half of boron diffusion, for NPP textures with higher A F/A proj, the nanopores and nanochannels adsorb and form more liquid diboron trioxide (B2O3) as the pre-deposition layer. Next, in the high-temperature drive-in step of boron diffusion, boron atoms from all directions diffuse into bulk silicon. Therefore, the NPP textures with higher A F/A proj forms more heavily dopant at the same diffusion time and temperature. For these NPP emitters, there is a nonlinear correlation between the junction depth and A F/A proj. The NPP emitter with A F/A proj of 4.51 shows a shallower junction depth of 0.92, corresponding to a higher R sheet, p + of 78.5 \u03a9/sq. And the NPP emitter with A F/A proj of 4.97 shows a deeper junction depth of 0.97, corresponding to a lower R sheet, p + of 75.1 \u03a9/sq. Differences in junction depth may be due to a variety of factors. On the one hand, ECV profiles measure the average value of carrier concentration at all positions (borehole wall, gully bottom, tip) after peeling off the same thickness doped layer. Different from planar samples and micron-pyramid samples with the conformable doping, the distance from different positions on NPP samples to p-n junction is different. The ECV profile results of NPP emitters can represent the doping property at average positions on NPP emitters [42], but cannot be sufficiently accurately reflecting the diffusion depth and describe the inward diffusion of boron atoms [43]. This requires refinement of the ECV test method and better characterization means to support this hypothesis. On the other hand, the rough surface is likely to make non-uniform diffusion and notable within-wafer uniformity variation by tube diffusion process; meanwhile, diffusion at different positions in the furnace tube also results in wafer-to-wafer uniformity variation, which requires more work and research to improve the uniformity and stability of boron doping. Effective passivation of NPP emitters is the critical issue to overcome the electrical loss caused by photogenerated carrier recombination. In this work, the stacked Al2O3/SiNx layers with excellent passivation are coated on NPP textures with different A F/A proj under the same deposition process [44]. The \u03c4 eff, iV oc, and J 0 measured by WCT-120 (Sinton) are used to analyze the amount of recombination occurring on silicon surface. In Fig. 5 (a\u2013c), the impact of A F/A proj on passivation performance parameters (\u03c4 eff, iV oc and J 0) of NPP cells before screen printing is visualized. As shown in Fig. 5a, the relationship between \u03c4 eff and A F/A proj can be expressed by a piecewise function. Taking the micron-pyramid texture with \u03c4 eff of 620 \u03bcs as a reference, the \u03c4 eff of NPP textures slowly decreases to 608 \u03bcs when A F/A proj increases from 1.79 to 4.51, and then the \u03c4 eff of NPP textures dramatically decreases to 540 \u03bcs when A F/A proj increases from 4.51 to 5.28. A similar trend is shown for iV oc in Fig. 5b. The relationship between J 0 and A F/A proj also is expressed as a similar piecewise function, but with the slight difference that the A F/A proj of 4.97 is a demarcation point in Fig. 5c. Taking the micron-pyramid texture with J 0 of 45 fA/cm2 as a reference, the J 0 of NPP textures slowly increases to 57 fA/cm2 when A F/A proj increases from 1.79 to 4.97, and then the J 0 of NPP textures dramatically increases to 67 fA/cm2 when A F/A proj increases from 4.97 to 5.28. These results reveal that the passivation performance exhibits a nonlinear piecewise decreasing trend with increased A F/A proj. The effect of increased A F/A proj on passivation performance of solar cells mainly includes two factors: (1) the increased surface defect states attributed to the rapid formation of a plasma-induced damaged layer and the simultaneous increase in surface area; (2) severe Auger recombination caused by higher N s and doping amount. To quantify the effect of surface morphology on emitter passivation, we resolved the emitter saturation current density (J 0e) using EDNA software [45]. Measurements of J 0e involve the contributions of all recombination mechanisms in emitter as follows [46]: J 0e = J 0e, Auger + J 0e, Radiative + J 0e, Surface SRH + J 0e, emitter SRH where J 0e, Auger represents the J 0 caused by Auger recombination in the emitter. J 0e, Radiative represents the J 0 caused by radiative (band-to-band) recombination in the emitter. J 0e, Surface SRH represents the J 0 caused by defects recombination on the emitter surface. J 0e, Emitter SRH represents the J 0 caused by defects recombination in the emitter. Since J 0e, Radiative and J 0e, Emitter SRH account for too little proportion of J 0e, the emitter recombination is mainly contributed by J 0e, Auger and J 0e, Surface SRH. Fig. 5d shows the emitter recombination separation of NPP textures as a function of A F/A proj. Comparing to NPP emitter with a high A F/A proj of 5.28 (J 0e, Auger \u223c 19.41 fA/cm2, J 0e, Surface SRH \u223c 39.27 fA/cm2), the J 0e, Auger and J 0e, Surface SRH of NPP emitters with the medium A F/A proj of 3.45\u20134.97 are significantly reduced. The improvements of J 0e, Auger and J 0e, Surface SRH are attributed to the reduction of N s, and the fact that a longtime pore-widening progress effectively removes the surface plasma-damage layer, respectively. When the A F/A proj decreases from 4.97 to 3.45, J 0e, Surface SRH of NPP emitters slowly decreases from 32.05 fA/cm2 to 29.98 fA/cm2, approaching that of conventional micron-pyramid emitter (27.05 fA/cm2); J 0e, Auger of NPP emitters decreased from 18.15 fA/cm2 to 15.02 fA/cm2, with an increase of 70%\u201380% relative to that of conventional micro-pyramid emitter (9.77 fA/cm2). In conjunction with Fig. 4, this higher J 0e, Auger of NPP emitters originates from the deeper junction depth and higher doping concentration. These results indicate that the stacked Al2O3/SiNx layers show a remarkable surface passivation effect on NPP emitters with medium A F/A proj regardless of the surface area, and at this moment, the Auger recombination dominates the NPP emitter recombination. In silicon-based solar cells, the more heavily doped the material is, the shorter the Auger recombination lifetime, which limits the effective lifetime and ultimate efficiency. In the future, we will focus on reducing the Auger recombination of NPP textures, such as preparing the selective emitter, and optimizing the boron diffusion process. Fig. 5e and f shows the relative PL luminescence intensity images of NPP cells with different A F/A proj under the same exposure conditions. The color difference of PL images characterizes the local passivation difference in detail, and the PL mean values marked in the figures reflect the global passivation quality. The remarkable negative relevant relationship between the PL mean values and A F/A proj is consistent with the trend in data measured by WCT-120. 3.3 Carriers collection Based on the superior photon collection of NPP textures and the brilliant surface passivation quality of the stacked Al2O3/SiNx layers, we prepared NPP TOPCon bifacial solar cells. To investigate the impact of NPP textures on optical absorption of the final cells, the EQE spectra of NPP cells with different A F/A proj from 3.45 to 5.28 were measured, with the conventional cells as reference. As shown in Fig. 6 a, NPP textures distinctly enhance the EQE in the short-wavelength range from 370 to 650 nm, and the J sc of TOPCon solar cells can be effectively improved by more short-wavelength absorption. The EQE spectra of NPP cells and conventional cells are highly coincident in the mid-long wavelength range above 650 nm, which is consistent with the reflectance spectra results compared to Fig. 3c. Different from the optical loss paths of silicon wafers, that of solar cells are more complex, including front-side escape, rear-side escape, front-side Ag/Al grid shadowing, front-side reflectance, poly-Si/SiNx parasitic absorption, front-side films parasitic absorption, and recombination in silicon bulk. The relationship between front surface structure and AR capability cannot be accurately described only by reflectance and EQE data of solar cells. According to the optical loss theory proposed by Bertrand et al. [47]. and the measured data, we analyzed the optical loss paths of NPP cells with different A F/A proj, as shown in Fig. 6b. The current density loss values caused by the front-side reflectance (J fr) and other paths are marked in Fig. 6b. Obviously, the difference in the optical loss of NPP cells with different A F/A proj is mainly on front-side reflectance, and overall the J fr decreases with the increase in A F/A proj. The J fr of conventional cells with A F/A proj of 1.79 is 1.52 mA/cm2, while the J fr of NPP cells with A F/A proj of 5.28 is 0.81 mA/cm2, a drop of 46.7%. The emitter textures with larger A F/A proj (>4.20) lay the foundation for improving the J sc of solar cells due to the lower J fr (<1 mA/cm2). However, at the PV module level, the short wavelength power gain of NPP cells is slightly weakened due to the light absorption below 360 nm wavelength in ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and glass [48]. Reducing the EVA/glass and poly-Si/SiNx parasitic absorption is the direction for future improvements in the optical performance of NPP cells. 3.4 Cell performance Table 2 summarizes the average photovoltaic parameter values of solar cells with different A F/A proj. Notably, the J sc of NPP cells was enhanced by NPP textures due to the excellent broadband spectral response. However, the relationship of J sc and A F/A proj is nonlinearly correlated due to factors such as poly-Si parasitic absorption and front-side Ag/Al grid shadowing. Among them, the NPP cells with A F/A proj of 4.51 exhibit the maximum J sc of 41.12 mA/cm2, which is 0.56 mA/cm2 above conventional micron-pyramid cells (J sc \u223c 40.55 mA/cm2). Meanwhile, the stacked Al2O3/SiNx films with brilliant passivation quality effectively suppress the surface recombination arising from high A F/A proj, which improve the electrical loss caused by the reduction of V oc. The V oc of NPP cells with A F/A proj less than or equal to 4.51 is greater than 689.2 mV, narrowing the gap within 2 mV than that of conventional cells (V oc \u223c 691.4 mV). In this situation, the J sc gain of NPP texture overcomes its appendant electrical loss, resulting in higher PCE than conventional cells. Ultimately, the NPP cells with A F/A proj of 4.51 show the largest average J sc of 41.12 mA/cm2, superior average V oc of 689.2 mV, and highest average PCE of 23.08%. A champion NPP cell, with the PCE of 23.24% and J sc of 41.17 mA/cm2, was obtained on 158.75 \u00d7 158.75 mm2 n-type monocrystalline silicon wafer. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristic curve and digital image taken vertically of the best NPP cell is shown in Fig. 7 , and identical solar cells, but with a random micron-pyramid texture, were fabricated as reference. In addition, as mentioned in section 3.1, the PECVD processing in this work does not well match the random micron-pyramid texture, resulting in an atypical thickness AR coating (\u223c95 nm). In future work, we will deeply investigate the matching between AR coatings and various textures with different geometry and size, and comprehensively compare optical and electrical properties between the optimal NPP texture cells and conventional micron-pyramid texture cells coated an optimal SiNx film. 4 Conclusions In summary, we successfully fabricate the high-efficiency NPP TOPCon bifacial solar cells with high J sc by optimizing the surface morphology of NPP structures using the buffer etching method. To identify the optimal size feature of NPP textures, the effects of different A F/A proj on structure size, boron doping, emitter recombination, and optical absorption are systematically analyzed. The results of reflection and EQE spectra reveal that the higher A F/A proj texture exhibits a stronger short-wavelength response and AR capability, which is beneficial to improve the J sc of solar cells. Paradoxically, the higher A F/A proj texture forms a heavily surface doping concentration, which results in a large amount of Auger recombination and surface recombination, thus eliminating the optical gain. The analysis results of WCT-120 and EDNA show that when the A F/A proj is less than or equal to 4.51, the high-quality stacked Al2O3/SiNx passivation films can effectively inhibit the surface recombination. The photoelectric performance measured by FCT-750 confirms that the enhanced J sc of NPP cells with moderate A F/A proj successfully surmounts the electrical loss caused by emitter recombination, showing an improvement in PCE. Finally, we prepared NPP cells with an average J sc of 41.12 mA/cm2 and an average PCE of 23.08%. This research results pave the way for the application of RIE technology in b-Si TOPCon solar cells.

Black silicon structure is commonly used to enhance the photogenerated current density (J ph) of crystalline solar cells due to its excellent light-trapping capability. However, the photogenerated current gain is cancelled by the increased emitter recombination current originated from the black silicon structure with a high enhanced surface area ratio. In this work, we used a buffered oxide etching solution to modify the surface morphology of nanopore/micron-pyramid composite (NPP) structure silicon. Further, we studied the effects of NPP structures with different enhanced surface area ratio on front-side reflection, boron atom doping, emitter passivation, and cell performance. By identifying the appropriate surface modification processing, we fabricated the large-scale (158.75 mm \u00d7 158.75 mm) bifacial TOPCon solar cells using industrial equipment and processes with an average short-circuit current density of 41.12 mA/cm2 and average conversion efficiency of 23.08%. Through adequately widening nanostructure size and depositing high-quality Al2O3/SiNx stacked passivation films on NPP structure surface, we achieved lower carrier recombination while maintaining high J ph.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2021-12-31", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927024821004517", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Xu, Jiahui"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chen, Cheng"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Cui"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chen, Jia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Zhifeng"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Yuan, Xiao"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Li, Hongbo"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927024821004517"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024821004517"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0927-0248(21)00451-7", "prism:volume": "233", "articleNumber": "111409", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "High-efficiency black silicon tunnel oxide passivating contact solar cells through modifying the nano-texture on micron-pyramid surface", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
