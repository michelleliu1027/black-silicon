The temperature and duration of diffusion process were optimized for fabricating nanoscopic silicon based solar cells using design of experiments (DoE) technique. The optimum nano-structure silicon substrate had been etched for 180s and had porosity of 25%, depth of 0.34\u202f\u03bcm and diameter of 99.8\u202fnm. Modeling and experimental design were implemented by D-optimal design of experiment with 12 random experiments. The temperature and time parameters were varied at ranges of 810\u2013910\u202f\u00b0C and 15\u201360\u202fmin, respectively. The result indicated that the diffused substrate at temperature of 840\u202f\u00b0C and time of 60\u202fmin had the highest voltage and current-density which were 0.607\u202fV and 24.32\u202fmA/cm2, respectively. The reflectance of fabricated optimum solar cell was gaged. The result presented that the reflectance of black silicon solar cell had been 600 times less than the non-porous solar cells using SiNx coated polished surface as antireflection layer. In addition, considerable gains of 13.64% on average efficiency, 0.53 on fill factor, 0.611\u202fV on open circuit voltage and 43.43\u202fmA/cm2 on current-density were achieved for optimum black silicon solar cell. Keywords Porous silicon solar cell Metal-assisted chemical etching Phosphorous diffusion Design of experiment D-optimal method 1 Introduction Solar cell technology is suitable for exploiting the energy from sun that is considered as the energy storage competitive with fossils. Specially, solar cell research assays to increase the power conversion efficiency [1\u20134]. Over 95% of all manufactured solar cells are combined by silicon and silicon-based solar cell market dominate on photovoltaic devices. The main reason for domination of silicon solar cells in world market is high quality silicon which fabricated in large quantities for microelectronic devices and its process does not burden any toxic material to the environment [5]. Diffusion process in silicon solar cells are traditionally performed using phosphorous oxychloride (POCL3) and phosphoric acid in a tube furnace. Due to its low toxicity and use of abundant materials and low cost, silicon solar cells hold in world photovoltaic market. Therefore many efforts have been developed an affordable phosphorous diffusion process because the emitter structure engineering for silicon solar cells can be strongly influenced on the emitter structure quality of solar cells and conversion efficiency of solar cells [6,7]. However, the environmental issues such as toxic byproducts exist in furnace exhaust and the prolonged heat-treatment are factors that affect the cost and efficiency of POCL3 diffusion system. In order to meet the commercial photovoltaic requirements, the various factors such as low cost, high efficiency production and high quality diffusion process have been advanced. Among phosphorous diffusion techniques, the cold spray diffusion as simple, high efficiency and low cost technique have been taken [8\u201311]. In addition, manufacturing the impressive nanoscopic silicon based solar cells is a fundamental requirement to get higher and broader spectral photo-responses across the spectrum of the solar irradiation range. The formation of emitter on porous structure not only play role in reducing surface carrier recombination velocity but also, it acts as anti-reflection (AR) layers reducing the light-reflection losses. Therefore, porous structured emitter has been intensively provided single design for silicon solar cells to amend the conversion efficiency. Nanostructures are the potential candidates due to their light harvesting properties over a wide spectral range (250\u20132500\u202fnm), attending intense attention for solar cells [12], hierarchical structures [13\u201315], photodetectors [16,17], and porous structures as the surface texturization [18\u201320]. Porous layers as photoluminescence layers can be able to absorb the short wavelength photons and emit the radiations in rather longer wavelength range that can be absorbed deeper in cells which could be collected more effectively. Front emitter transparent is shifted to the incident short wavelength radiations by PL layers as down shifter and result in development the spectral response of cell in the region [21,22]. Porous structures bestow eligible possible for application in photovoltaic devices because of incredible characteristics of nanoscopic black silicon such as high surface-to-volume ratios, adjusted energy band gap, high photoconductivity, photo-absorption across the solar irradiation range and passivating surface without any antireflection, [23]. Various procedures such as reactive-ion etching, laser-induced etching, electro-chemical etching and metal-assisted chemical etching have been designed for constructing porous structures. To fabricate nanoscopic silicon, several methods such as reactive-ion etching and laser-induced etching as expensive, uneven and sophisticated methods for nanostructure fabrication have been commonly applied. In recent years, metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) which is concluded a noble metal (such as Ag, Au, Cu and etc.) in an aqueous solution based on HF and an oxidation agent, has attracted incredible attention in fields of photovoltaic, optoelectronic and electronic devices due to it is a simple, cost-effective, controllable and high-throughput method for fabricating nanoscopic silicon [24]. However extensive and significant studies have been done on the applications of porous nanoscopic silicon structures in the field of photovoltaics, the benefits of design of experiment as a potent and efficient tool for engineering the diffusion process and formation of n+- junction on a p-porous rugged silicon substrate in experimental studies have not been reported yet. Since characterization of theoretical data is important in experimental surveys, adaption of modeling and results of experiments is significantly considered. Design of experiment is an effective tool for maximizing the amount of information gained from a study while minimizing the amount of data to be collected [25]. In addition, it is a structured and organized way of conducting and analyzing controlled tests to evaluate the factors that affect a response variable. The tabulated classical designs such as full factorial designs, fractional factorial designs, Latin square designs, Box-Behnken designs and etc. do not incorporate user constraints. Prasad et al. described the application of Six Sigma Define\u2013Measure\u2013Analyze\u2013Improve\u2013Control methodology for throughput improvement of the phosphorus doping process. The optimized algorithm had been implemented in the production and it was running successfully [26]. As a result of this project, an effective gain of 0.9\u202fMW was reported per annum. Among optimal design soups (D-A-G-V-optimal) the D-optimal design is better than others because of its significant efficiency about search algorithm. The D-optimal design is applied for minimizing the generalized variance of the parameter estimators [27]. Achieving a clear understanding of diffusion process on p-porous silicon substrates through modeling is a principal step towards optimal utilization of its advantages. Therefore, D-optimal design of experiment has applied in this investigation to engineer the phosphorous diffusion process on porous heterogeneous silicon substrates by changing main factors (time and temperature) which affect the structure of silicon solar cells. Essentially, this study is based on the engineering of n+ ps/p junctions in nanoscopic silicon substrates to use the optimum structure in photovoltaic application. Based on the best of the authors knowledge the rare investigations have been done on the adaption of modeling and experiment results about diffusion process in nanoscopic structures. In this study, the D-optimal design of experiment is used for improving efficiency of investigated design to cover our constraint range of parameters. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation and optimization of porous silicon P-type mono-crystalline Si(100) wafers (resistivity 5\u201310\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm, thickness 640 \u00b1 10\u202f\u03bcm) were used in this investigation. The area of wafers was the size of 1.50 \u00d7 1.50\u202fcm2. In initial step, the surfaces of wafers were pre-texturized by 30% KOH (Merck) for 2\u202fmin\u202fat 70\u201380\u202f\u00b0C. Then wafers were cleaned in a mixture of 2.3\u202fml HF (Merck, 40%) and 2.2\u202fml HCL (Merck, 35%) at room temperature for 10\u202fmin and rinsed by deionized (DI) water. The MACE method was used for fabrication of nanoscopic silicon as pictured in Fig. 1 a. Ag nanoparticles were deposited via an electroless method dipping samples in an aqueous solution including 1.3\u202fml HF and 0.0085\u202fg AgNO3 at room temperature for 90s. Three different nanoscopic silicon fabricated by etching silicon in three different times (90, 180 and 270s). The samples were weighted before (m1) and after etching (m2) and mass loss calculated. To make uniform porous layers, the samples were dipped in a 0.5\u202fwt% KOH solution. Finally, the samples were dipped in a diluted HNO3 (Merck, 65%) solution for 10\u202fmin to remove Ag nanoparticles and rinsed by DI water. Again after drying in last step, the samples were weighted (m3) and the following Eq. (3). the porosity of structures was calculated. The dissolution mechanisms are discussed at high HF/H2O2 ratio, which no formation of oxide is not formed at the surface and based on a localized hole injection from Ag nanoparticles to Si surface. At the level of Ag nanoparticles, meso and macropores are formed correlating to the Ag nanoparticle size. Prior to enhancing the Si dissolution, Ag+ ions in the vicinity of Si surface withdraw the electron from Si and are deposited as Ag nuclei. The stocked Ag nuclei attract electrons from Si because of higher electronegativity than Si. In this approach, either SiO2 is formed or Si is etched as Ag ions are reduced. These Ag nanoparticles catalyzes Si etching in HF/H2O2 solution. After metallization process, the Si sample is etched in the HF and commonly H2O2 as oxidizing agent. Therefore, the etching solutions is characterized by their molar ratio, named \u03c1 = [ HF ] ( [ HF ] + [ H 2 O 2 ] ) . In the following, we select a solution (\u03c1 \u223c 82%) reported in the literature conducting in the formation of porous Si but we investigate the properties of porous Si by varying etching time. Etching time is an important factor that affect the kind of porous structures as high etching time produce large-area Si nanowire arrays while macro and mesoporous structures are produced at short etching time. It has been investigated that the length of Si nanowires formed by metal-assisted chemical etching in HF/H2O2 solution raised approximately linearly with the etching time. In addition, for the investigation of morphology, the distance between metal nanoparticles and patches incredibly affect the morphology of the porous structures. It was presented that the separated Ag nanoparticles catalyze the etching isolated pores but for high density of Ag nanoparticles (e.g., due to a raise in deposition time), they overlap and isolated wire structures were achieved. Also, if the Ag nanoparticles do not overlap, but are effectively close together, Si nanowires might be fabricated [28,29]. 2.2 Fabrication of n + PS/p silicon junctions At first step, as was shown at Fig. 1 b the solution including of 3% P2O5 and 10\u22123\u202fM triton as a surfactant was sprayed over nanoscopic silicon wafers. After that, nanoscopic wafers were dried at 250\u202f\u00b0C for 20\u202fmin. The diffusion process was performed at different diffusion temperatures and times. A D-optimal design of experiment was carried out at 2 levels to indicate the effect of the operation factors on the responses (voltage and current density). Diffusion temperature (A) and diffusion time (B) were considered as autonomous factors at design constrains 930.00 \u2264 A+2B \u2264 960.00. It was noticed that the range of constrains referred to usual range of time and temperature of diffusion process. The input variables on the experiment are called factors. The performance measures results of experiments are called responses [25]. The values of factors were given in Table 1 . In Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) multinomial equations were applied to predict the responses (Y1 and Y2) as functions of autonomous factors and their interactions. In this study, the number of autonomous factors was 2, therefore the voltage response for the quadratic multinomial became (1) Y 1 = \u03b2 0 + \u2211 \u03b2 i x i + \u2211 \u03b2 i i x i 2 + \u2211 \u2211 \u03b2 i j x i x j And For the current response, the cubic multinomial became (2) Y 2 = \u03b2 0 + \u2211 \u03b2 i x i + \u2211 \u03b2 i i x i 2 + \u2211 \u03b2 i i i x i i i 3 + \u2211 \u2211 \u03b2 i j x i x j + \u2211 \u2211 \u03b2 i j x i x j 2 + \u2211 \u2211 \u03b2 i j x i 2 x j Where \u03b2 0 . \u03b2 i . \u03b2 i i . \u03b2 i i i . \u03b2 i j were constant, linear, square, cubic and interaction regression coefficient terms, respectively; xi and xj are autonomous factors (A and B). Interaction is presented when the effect of a factor on the response variable depends on the setting level of another factor [25]. In this study, 12 design points were obtained which had whole range of two factors but four of them were removed in order to achieve the normal plot of responses. The values of responses were given in Table 2 . The results of D-optimal design were given in Table 1 according to experiments. The above results had a confidence interval (CI) of 95% for model of both responses. In statistics, CI is a kind of interval estimation of normal plot and two main factors and also, is utilized to show the validity of a survey. The level of confidence of the CI shows the probability that the confidence range takes the valid population factors for a given distribution of models [30,31]. At third step, the diffused wafers were rinsed into diluted HF for 2\u20133s. Finally, the contacts were fabricated on the diffused optimum sample and that was the result of D-optimal design of experiment. It should be noted that we fabricated the non-porous silicon solar cell for comparison between optimum porous silicon solar cell at the same condition. 3 Characterization The surface morphologies of nanoscopic porous wafers were investigated via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, MIRA3 TESCAN). The structural characterization of substrates was evaluated via X-ray diffractometer (XRD) system (X'Pert HighScore Plus). Design-Expert 7 software was used for multi regression analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of maximum of data in the response surface regression (REGRS) method. Also, the fit beauty of the model was estimated by the coefficient of determination (R2) and its statistical significance was investigated by the F-test. The optical properties of un-doped porous wafers were measured via CARY ECLIPSE photoluminescence spectroscopy. The reflectance curves were measured by Phystec co spectroscopy. The electrical characterization was performed using the I\u2013V by Sharif solar simulator co under AM 1.5\u202fG spectral irradiance (100\u202fmW/cm2 at 25\u202f\u00b0C). 4 Result and discussion In Fig. 2 . FE-SEM images demonstrate the comparison of surface morphologies of three porous substrates. It can be seen that the nanoscopic structures have been fabricated as curved shape and cylinders (measured by digimizer software) which have the average depth of 0.27, 0.34 and 0.4\u202f \u03bc m and the average diameter of 96.8, 99.8 and 183.4\u202fnm, respectively. Also, their porosities are achieved to 18%, 25%, and 42%, respectively using Eq. (3). Different times of etching process (90, 180 and 270s) lead to different surface morphologies shown in Fig. 2a-c, respectively. The size and shape of metal nanoparticles affect the morphology and reflectance properties of textured silicon surface in metal-assisted chemical etching method [32]. Also, the involved chemical reactions are incredibly complex and hard to control resulting in thin as well as inhomogeneous porous silicon structures [33]. It should be noted that the etching duration higher than 270s makes the demolished surface and shorter than 90s does not result in specific morphology (not shown here). These images clearly indicate that the average diameter of nanoscopic structures increases proportional to etching duration. As increasing the etching duration to 270s, the cylinder morphologies clearly become irregular inverted conical as shown in Fig. 2 c. Furthermore, with increasing etching time the depth of structures increases to 0.4\u202f \u03bc m.Using etching solution with 70 < \u03c1 < 100 and high proportion of HF, curved and straight cylindrical pores are formed with diameter matching the size of Ag nanoparticles [34]. (3) Porosity = m 1 \u2212 m 2 m 1 \u2212 m 3 \u00d7 100 % Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the silicon substrates etched at different times 90s, 180s, and 270s. The spectra of the non-porous silicon substrate are also included for comparison. XRD peaks of etched samples is close to non-porous silicon peak which is an evidence for crystallite structure of porous silicon. Increasing etching time results in expansion of peak widths because of reduced crystallite size. The small peak around 38\u00b0 could be attributed to formation of AgF and AgF2. The average crystallite size of substrates has been calculated using Debye-Scherrer formula [35]. The achieved values are 373, 59, and 24A\u00b0 for the etching times of 90s, 180s, and 270s, respectively. The reduction in the crystallite size at high etching time can be driven from the enhancement of full wide at half maximum values at diffraction peaks that the achieved values are 767, 80, and 28A\u00b0 for the etching time of 90s, 180s, and 270s, respectively. Finally, the results of XRD show that the etched substrate at 180s has structural characterization among another substrates. Fig. 4 shows that the PL intensity significantly increases by etching duration while does not affect peak positions. There is relevance between PL spectrum and the metal-assisted chemical etching method. The shifts in the PL spectra are related to the structural modifications of porous silicon layers fabricated by etching method. The PL intensity is incredibly increased by etching surface time which is correlated to increase of the silicon nanostructure density according to the quantum confinement prediction [36]. Ledoux et al. had measured the photoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals and reported their yield that is as a function of nanocrystal sizes. They found that the results of photoluminescence followed the quantum-confinement model [37]. The PL spectra demonstrates emission peaks centered at two positions which are from right to left, green to blue, respectively. The first one situate in green region; while, the second one is more intense and correlate to emission in the blue region. The decrease of the crystallite size and the pore population are led the blue emission. It is found that the shift of PL peak to the green region at 545\u202fnm can be correlated to formation of AgF and AgF2. These results also, are in agreement with XRD result that both emissions for 270s are the sharpest because of its crystallite size and concentration of AgF and AgF2 in its structure. the emission of two peaks is due to the presentation of various porous morphologies which have various radiative recombination centers [36]. Also, it is seen that we have achieved to maximum and minimum values of etching range and the second one has a modified shape. ANOVA results indicate significant models with adequate precisions of 13.435 and 73.141, respectively for voltage and current-density responses. Adequate precision measures the signal to noise ratio, and a ratio greater than 4 is eligible [38]. Here, the ratio is greater than 4 for both responses. The fitting quality of the equations is explained by the coefficient of regression adjusted R-squared or in better way by predicted R-squared. The adjusted R-squared values demonstrate variability in the observed response values which can be presented by the experimental factors and their interactions [38]. The predicted and adjusted R-squared values are closer to 1, indicating that the better fitting is attained. The predicted R-squared value of voltage and current-density responses are 0.6818 and 0.8226, respectively that are in reasonable adaption with 0.8897 and 0.9982 which are the adjusted R-squared values for voltage and current-density responses. The model F-values of 18.74 and 663.07 imply for voltage and current-density, respectively that the models are significant and there are only 0.13 and 0.15 chance for model responses that both model F-values could occur due to noise. To predict quadratic multinomial model for Y1 the quadratic regression coefficients are given in Eq. (5). The linear terms, interaction term and the quadratic terms of A and B are significant for Y1 (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). (5) Y 1 3 = 0.15 - 0.11A - 0.09B + 0.78AB + 0.43 A 2 + 0.37 B 2 In addition, to predict cubic multinomial model for Y2 the cubic regression coefficients are given in Eq. (6). The linear terms, the interaction term, the quadratic terms and the cubic terms of A and B are significant for Y2 (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). (6) 1 Y 2 + 0.2 = - 1.92 - 12.96A - 8.72B + 255.40AB + 141.32 A 2 + 116.06B2 - 633.18 A 2 B - 572.19 AB 2 - 230.05 A 3 - 173.31 B 3 Validation of each factor is defined in the process for example, when the value of the Sum of square increases, the importance of the corresponding factor increases in the following process [39]. It could be seen in Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively that the effect of B2 is highest in the model of voltage response and also in the model of current density response; the effect of A3 is the highest one. In Fig. 5 a-b, the experimental values are accurately close to the predicted ones. If the data points be close to the straight line, the data are normally distributed [39]. By this mean that, our experiment data taken from a normal distribution. In Fig. 6 . FE-SEM images indicate the comparison of surface morphologies of porous substrates before and after diffusion in fabrication process of solar cell. It can be seen that the diffusion conditions (840\u00b0C-60min and 893.25\u00b0C-29.63min) does not have destructive effect on morphology of macro porous layers shown in Fig. 6b-c, respectively. Also, their diameters are calculated average value of 99.8\u202fnm as same as before annealing. It should be noted that accordance with DoE modeling, the diffusion condition of 840\u00b0C-60min is correlated to optimum solar cell and 893.25\u00b0C-29.63min condition is related to fair solar cell (not mentioned here). Mesoporous silicon layer has been formed in outer part of n+ emitter of a p-n+ junction due to its instability at high annealing but the macro porous layer is fabricated on raw wafer just after the pre-texturization [40]. It is found that this structure is desirable to fabricate porous silicon solar cells. The potential properties of porous silicon have made this structure as a remarkable candidate which is beneficial for enhancing light-trapping potency in visible spectra [41]. The structure of matt black macroporous results in multiple reflection of light arrays on the pore walls, deducing in an improved ability of photon absorption and reduction of reflectivity [40]. The antireflection ability of our matt black silicon solar cell is indicated in Fig. 7 . The reflectance varies over the wavelength range of 450\u2013800\u202fnm. As shown in Fig. 7, the reflectance of both of them illustrates in their color region but peak of non-porous silicon solar cell is remarkably 600 times sharper than fabricated black silicon solar cell. For SiNX coated solar cell, the incident wave is absorbed or transmitted into cell due to the phase opposition of considered wavelength and ARC/substrate interface. But finally, some amount of incident wavelength is reflected because of internal reflection of interference [42]. While, for the black nanoscopic silicon solar cell, the exposed area is increased and because of the structure and morphology of surface nanostructured array, the light harvesting and also concentrated incoming light are incredibly enhanced near the surface in broad wavelength range [24]. P-n junction fabricates a selective barrier for intercepting charge carrier and making a pass way for holes and electrons to the p and n contacts, respectively [43,44]. The J-V curves of fabricated solar cell using optimized nanoscopic silicon and non-porous silicon are indicate in Fig. 8 . Singh et al. have investigated the influence of various phosphorous diffusion factors such as pre-diffusion temperature, drive-in temperature, process time on the emitter thickness and conversion efficiency of solar cells. They achieved that a low diffusion temperature has made a shallower emitter with value of 0.453\u03bc. Cell efficiency was strongly affected by emitter thickness. So that, efficiency of cells reported to be 10.81% and 7.62% for shallow and deep emitter cells respectively. In addition, they found that a great open circuit voltage was achieved for shallower emitter [45]. Also, Li et al. have reported that n+ emitters were formed in a liquid POCl3 tube furnace at a temperature of 850\u202f\u00b0C [46]. Our results show that by modeling and engineering the diffusion process on the optimum nanoscopic substrate, the optimum temperature and time are 840\u202f\u00b0C and 60\u202fmin, respectively. In this survey, we illustrate an effective diffusion scheme for nanoscopic black silicon fabricated by MACE method. In our case porosity does not increase electric loss so much because of our result from non-porous silicon solar cell, made at the same fabrication process with porous silicon solar cell, indicate that the efficiency of porous silicon solar cell achieves to 13.64% in comparison to 11% for non-porous silicon solar cell. It is found that the appearance of structural defects and surface recombination reduce the open circuit voltage. Although, the short circuit current density is increased due to increasing the light absorption properties of front surface. Finally, the result overall the low reflectance effect has dominant influence on performance of solar cell as the same investigations [42,47]. The electrical loss which is caused by application of metal contacts on porous structures is minimized using thermal annealing process of contacts. Here, the lattice mismatch between top-contacts and porous silicon is reduced and the stability of electrical contacts is enhanced. Thus, the electrical loss is minimized. By incorporated the surface morphology modification, emitter optimization modeling and technique, the results of solar cells are given in Table 5 . 5 Conclusion In this paper, the modeling and engineering of the diffusion process on the nanoscopic silicon substrate were studied. The optimum etching duration for fabricating nano-structure silicon substrate for photovoltaic application had been found 180s caused to porosity of 25%, depth of 0.34\u202f\u03bcm and diameter of 99.8\u202fnm. By modeling and engineering the diffusion process on the nanoscopic substrate, it was determined that the optimum diffusion temperature and time were 840\u202f\u00b0C and 60\u202fmin, respectively. Also, effective factors on the voltage and current-density responses were identified B2 and A3, respectively. Also it is found that, the XRD result was in agreement with PL result in both of them by increasing the etching time, the crystallite size was reduced to around 24A\u00b0. In addition, formation of AgF and AgF2 is detected in both analysis while this impurity was vanished for 180s etching time. In addition, the competition between the black nanoscopic silicon solar cell and SiNX coated solar cell showed that the black nanoscopic silicon solar cell significantly reduced the optical reflection losses 600 times less than SiNx coated solar cell. Finally, \u03b7 of 13.64%, FF of 0.53, VOC of 0.611\u202fV and JSC of 43.43\u202fmA/cm2 were obtained to merge the modification of silicon surface morphology and optimization of diffusion process without any protective and passivation layer such as SiO2/SiNx. Meanwhile, our result from non-porous silicon solar cell made at the same fabrication process with porous silicon solar cell indicated that the incorporation of nanostructures caused to an unavoidable increase in surface area, designing the structures with superior light-harvesting properties with minimal recombination loss played an important role to achieve high performance of 13.64% in comparison 11% for non-porous silicon solar cell. In this report, the temperature and duration of diffusion process were optimized for fabricating nanoscopic silicon solar cells using design of experiments (DoE) technique. The performance of nanoscopic solar cells could be further improved by optimizing pre-deposition temperature, and gas flows as effective parameters on p-n junction and even other main factors of fabricated nanostructures like annealing temperature of nanoparticles, duration time of their deposition and concentration of etching solution as based silicon solar cells.
