As diamond wire sawn (DWS) technique for multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si) becomes mainstream wafering technology in Si-based photovoltaic industry, metal assisted chemical etching (MACE) method will become a key technique to improve conversion efficiency. Due to the intrinsic characteristic of Ag nanoparticles precipitation reaction in solution in the first step of MACE, a large number of deep nanopores are produced on the surface of mc-Si wafer in the following etching step. The deep nanopores can lead to the degradation of mc-Si solar cell's performances. Thus, the influences of Ag-ion concentration in the first step of MACE on the solar cell's performances was carefully studied. It's found that with the increasing of Ag-ion concentration, the light trapping capabilities keeps improving. However, the solar cell's electric performances deteriorate dramatically when Ag-ion concentration reaches to a certain value. Optical and electrical simulation is performed to explain the influences of deep nanopores on the mc-Si solar cell's performances. It is found that there is an optimum Ag-ion concentration value to enhance the mc-Si solar cell's performances, and an efficiency of 18.94% is obtained for large size of 156.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f156.75\u202fmm2 wafer. An absolute efficiency of 0.5% was improved as compared to the conventional acidic textured DWS mc-Si solar cell. It shows the necessity of controlling the Ag-ion concentration in the manufacture of black silicon. Keywords Diamond wire sawn (DWS) Ag-metal assisted chemical etching (MACE) Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) Deep nanopores Sentaurus TCAD 1 Introduction The multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell with relatively low conversion efficiency has attained dominance in the silicon solar cell market due to its low cost. Texturization technology is considered to be one of crucial factors to narrow the gap between mono-crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell and mc-Si solar cell in conversion efficiency. Diamond wire sawn (DWS) is expected to be the mainstream wafering technology in Si-based photovoltaic industry. The DWS technique for mc-Si has several advantages such as larger output of wafers per ingot, higher precision enabling production of thinner wafers, lower environmental impact, easier recovery of silicon kerf loss and less surface mechanical damages [1\u20136]. Black silicon has a nanostructured porous layer on the surface of a silicon wafer, and is capable of suppressing light reflection in a wavelength range of 300\u20131100 nm. Black silicon technique might help DWS mc-Si overcome unsuccessfully texturing based on traditional HF + HNO3 etching mixtures system. There are many methods to form a nanostructured porous layer on silicon surface, such as dry reactive ion etching (RIE) [7], femtosecond laser technique [8], electrochemical etching [9], and metal assisted chemical etching (MACE) [10]. MACE technique took the lowest cost for its wet chemical process and has more potential in large area fabrication. Different from isotropic etching of traditional HF + HNO3 mixtures system [11,12], MACE technique involves anisotropic and isotropic etching to form nanoscale texture. Black silicon contributes a great potential improvement in silicon solar cell conversion efficiency due to excellent light absorbance, while the enlarged defective surface would increase the specific surface area and Auger recombination rate of photogenerated carriers [13]. To mitigate this problem, the post-processing solution is introduced which makes significant achievement toward industrialization. Even so, there are always a crowd of deep nanopores on silicon surface, which results in the aperiodicity of nanostructure and aggravating lateral transport in the front surface of the cell. Since the post-etching processes of nano-pores have the isotropic etching characteristics, the original deep nano-pores forming in mixed solution of H2O2 and HF would be eliminated but the shallow nano-pores would be totally polished at the same time. The reported studies always focus on how to optimize the MACE process but there are few studies concentrating on the simulation method to improve the cell efficiency. Traditional alkaline texturing of crystal silicon produces linear boundary pyramidal structure which is easily to rebuild on software and take less time to simulate. Nanostructure etched by MACE method is oval pits shape which is arc curve, semicircular curve or semi-elliptic curve. Sentaurus TCAD was used to simulate the optical and electrical characteristic of solar cell textured by Ag based MACE method. In the current work, it's focused on the first step of MACE in which Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) will be deposited on silicon wafer in different Ag-ion concentration. The effects of various recipes of Ag-ion concentration on the surface morphology of silicon are investigated in detail. The mechanism of forming deep nanopores on silicon wafer is discussed. After that, the influences of Ag+ concentration on the reflectivity, the surface passivation and the solar cell efficiency are investigated. In order to make clear light trapping structures and clarify its photocarriers transporting mechanism, 180\u202f\u03bcm thick silicon solar cell were simulated. Given the optimized Ag+ concentration, an improvement of efficiency was achieved as compared to that of the conventional acidic textured DWS mc-Si. 2 Experiment P-Type DWS mc-Si wafers (180\u202f\u00b1\u202f20\u202f\u03bcm thick, specific resistivity of 1\u20133\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm) with standard solar wafer size of 156.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f156.75\u202fmm2 were used for this work. The alkali texture was taken as a primary process to remove the mechanical damage layer of DWS mc-Si. For two-step MACE method, the wafers were first immersed in the HF solution containing AgNO3 with different Ag-ion concentration (0.001\u20130.1\u202fM), called the first step. During this step, a large number of Ag nanoparticles with various size were deposited on the DWS mc-Si wafer surface. Then, the wafers with adsorbed nano-sized Ag particles were etched in the mixed solution of H2O2 and HF with the ratio of 3:10 to form the nanoholes structure. The as-etched mc-Si wafers were immersed into the solution containing ammonia or HNO3 to remove the remaining silver particles on the mc-Si. To obtain better structure for solar cell, the semi-finished black silicon was restructured in post-processing solution at room temperature. The DWS mc-Si wafers were rinsed in deionized water (DIW) at room temperature (RT) after each step. In order to apply nanostructure to solar cell, all textured DWS mc-Si wafer were undergone standard cell processing, including: phosphorus diffusion to form p-n junction emitters, back etching to remove backside PN junctions and phosphorosilicate glass and isolate edge, PECVD to deposit the SiNx antireflection/passivation layer, and screen printing to metallise top/bottom electrodes. Then the solar cells were tested in an automatic testing and sorting machine. In addition, simulation software Sentaurus TCAD was used to investigate etching mechanism by process module and electrical characteristics by process and device module. Surface morphology was characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi, S4800, Chiyoda-ku, Japan). The reflectivity, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were evaluated by measurement of the incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) using a solar cell measurement system (sofn, 7-SCSpecII, China). The sheet resistance was tested by 4D auto five points probe meter (MODEL 280). The minority carrier lifetime was measured by quasi-steady-state photoconductance method with a Sinton WCT-120. The output-performance of solar cells were measured by sunlight simulator under standard testing conditions(AM1.5G, 1000W/m2, 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Etching mechanism and as-etched morphology comparison When the silicon wafers are immersed into the deposition solution, AgNPs are deposited on the silicon surfaces with two processes occurring simultaneously: the cathodic reaction (hydrogen evolution and reduction of Ag+ ions, which produces metallic Ag deposits [Eq. (1)]) and the anodic reaction (oxidation of silicon [Eq. (2)]). During the two processes, the charges released by the oxidation of silicon atoms are transferred to the sites of silver deposition [14]. Fig. 1 shows AgNPs were deposited on the silicon substrate with different Ag-ion concentration while the HF concentration and solution temperature were kept constant. From Fig. 1(a)\u2013s. 1(f), it can be seen the average size of AgNPs and the number of unusually large AgNPs increase gradually. Besides, the sites distribution of larger AgNPs exhibits a certain randomness indicating reaction between Ag-ion and Si and nucleation of silver elements are stochastic. This may relate to wettability of the solution to the silicon wafer, thus Ag+ ions tend to aggregate and form silver particles at the more wettable areas. In addition, when the concentration of Ag+ ions is constant, the probability of forming larger silver particles in the step 1 is substantially constant. The higher the concentration of silver, the higher the probability of silver atoms agglomerating to form large volume silver particles. Besides, pretreatment inevitably creates surface irregularity which also contributes a factor involved in AgNPs reaction. Further discussions on pretreatment are needed in the future researching.

In the silicon nanoholes fabrication process, the AgNPs act as catalyst to etch silicon wafer fast in solution with certain oxidants. Since the electrochemical potential of H2O2 is much more positive than the valence band of Si, this is why a bare Si substrate could be etched very slowly in HF/H2O2 [15]. The reaction follows Equation (3) [16]. (3) Si + n 2 H 2 O 2 + 6 H F \u2192 n H 2 O + H 2 S i F 6 + ( 4 \u2212 n ) 2 H 2 \u2191 The etching of silicon in post-processing solution is described as a two-step chemical process including: (i) the formal oxidation of silicon to SiO2 by oxidant and (ii) the subsequent dissolution of formed SiO2 by acid [17\u201319]. Fig. 2 shows the reproduction of nanoholes structure using process simulation of Sentaurus TCAD. Fig. 2(a) shows anisotropic etching that creates hollow channels on front surface of silicon which supported the etching mechanism of MACE. Oval nanopores texture in Fig. 2(b) is formed by isotropic etching after anisotropic etching in Fig. 2(a) which is the ultimate functional structure to capture light waves. Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show the acidic textured surface cross-sectional SEM images. The microstructure on surface distributes along a straight line and deep microstructure exist on wafer surface. Fig. 4 (a)\u2013(l) compares the surface and cross-sectional SEM images of DWS mc-Si treated under different Ag-ion concentration. It can be clearly seen that all sample surfaces are densely crowded with oval nanopore array, and both the structure size and surface morphology are strongly related to the Ag-ion concentration (Fig. 4(a)\u2013(l)). Fig. 4(a) and (b) show that low Ag-ion concentration contributes to the shallow nanopore array which have poor light trapping ability. As can be seen from Fig. 4(c)\u2013(h), with the Ag-ion concentration increasing from 0.005\u202fM to 0.02\u202fM, more as-etched deep nanopores show up and nanoholes become deeper in average. It's considered have something to do with large AgNPs under which the silicon is etched more intensely. When the Ag-ion concentration is too high (Fig. 4(i)\u2013(l)), both the number and depth of deep nanoholes have increased dramatically. Moreover, the deep nanoholes tend to merge and tilting characteristics of nanoholes are more obvious. The structure results and surface morphology in Fig. 4 are consistent with the distribution of AgNPs in Fig. 1. Appearance of whole substrate changes from brighter and uniform to darker but having clear demarcation. When etching depth under AgNPs grows, difference of as-etched structure among crystal grains become bigger. If these differences keep growing, it will gradually appear in solar cell appearance which can't be concealed by following passivation layer. 3.2 Optical and electrical characteristic comparison of different nanostructure These oval pits structure in Fig. 4 would lead to light harvesting effect due to effective medium theory (EMT) and gradient refractive index theory (GRIN) [20]. For nanoholes surfaces, the light interacts with the whole surface rather than interacting with each rough spot, preventing light from escaping back to air. Reflectance curves for each sample were shown in Fig. 5 . With the Ag-ion concentration increase in step 1, the reflectance of wafers is quickly reduced first. When Ag-ion concentration exceeds 0.02\u202fM, the increase in Ag-ion concentration decreases the reflectance of silicon to a small extent but the structure of silicon wafers become poor and structure has more corners and protrusions tips. A balance must be made to reach the optimal performance. Three-dimensional optical model was built in Sentaurus TCAD to simulate the optical generation rate and photocarriers transport of deep nanopores structure. In addition, optical model has an 80\u202fnm anti-reflection coating (ARC) of SiNx atop the texturing to be consistent with industry-typical cells. Fig. 6 a shows upper part view of silicon solar cell which has a 1\u202f\u03bcm by 5\u202f\u03bcm area structure with thickness of 200\u202f\u03bcm. Fig. 6b shows bottom part of black silicon solar cell. In the front part of solar cell, the silver electrodes are located on both sides of the nanoholes. In the bottom part of solar cell, the whole bottom surface is set as electrode. Fig. 7 a shows doping profile on top of cell. In Fig. 7b and Figs. 7c, the absorbed photon density and optical generation of black silicon solar cell has almost same profile. Greater light absorption capacity means more photocarriers. In Fig. 7c, the optical generation rate on cross-sectional of 3D model is calculated using an AM1.5G spectrum and its value is highlighted by color. It can be seen that the optical generation rate is the highest at the surface of the wafer and decays to smaller values at a deeper depth, which has similar tendency with minority carrier recombination rate distribution. The vast majority of optical generation concentrates in lowest part of nanohole. More specifically, recombination rate of minority carrier peak value distributes all around the oval pit, which is identified with doping profile of cell front field. As the density of those deep nanoholes increases, the doping depth of the upper portion of the solar cell increases, and the highly doped region becomes larger. At the same time, the recombination rate also increases. Fig. 7e indicates that the transverse transport of photocarriers also dominates at the surface of the silicon. These deep nanoholes prolong the transportation distance of photocarriers and give more chances for recombination and high recombination rate around nanoholes also decrease the chance for photocarriers to arrive electrodes. So, the position and density of nanopores can affect the transport and the collection of photocarriers. It is obvious that deep nanopores blocked in the transport path combined with high recombination ratio will do harm to the collection of carriers. In Fig. 7b, c and e, the absorbed photon density and optical generation of shallow nanoholes on surface is lower than that of deep nanoholes but they have smaller recombination rate. When the 4 nanoholes on surface are all deep nanoholes, the electrical characteristics of solar cell turn to be the worst. It's similar to the structure at the highest Ag ions concentration. The sheet resistance of substrates was measured after diffusion and back etching, and the minority carrier lifetime of wafers was measured when the wafers were passivated by SiNx. The average sheet resistance values keep dropping from 108.85\u03a9/\u25a1 to 72.61\u03a9/\u25a1 which indicates that protrusions tips between nanoholes make it easier to form highly doped region on surface [21]. Moreover, tiny silver particles that is difficult to remove embedded in deep nanopores of silicon wafer may become deep level impurity when diffused and make a contribution to sheet resistance decreasing. Deep nanopores have larger aspect ratio which makes it difficult to deposit functional thickness ARC of SiNx on side wall. Effective lifetime as a measure of the combined effects of volume recombination and surface recombination [22]. Effective lifetime, \u03c4 eff , volume lifetime, \u03c4 bulk , and surface lifetime, \u03c4 surf , are related as (4) 1 \u03c4 e = 1 \u03c4 v + 1 t s For same batch substrates, the effective lifetime can be used to reflecting influence of various recipes Ag-ion concentration. The above points may give explanations to the decrease of minority carrier lifetime from 63.12\u03bcs to 13.32\u202f\u03bcs 3.3 Solar cells fabrication and performance comparison Nanoholes array made by MACE method with 6 kinds of Ag-ion concentration were chosen for standard silicon solar cell fabrication. In Fig. 8 , wavelength dependence of reflectivity, external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) are shown for those solar cells with different nano structures. Compare to Fig. 5, after SiNx layers coating, the reflectance of nanopore array structure in Fig. 8a decrease significantly, but the gaps among different samples narrow down. Whether Ag-ion concentration both too low or too high, the lowest point of the corresponding reflectance moves to the long wavelength direction which will mismatch with AM1.5G spectrum. When Ag-ion concentration around 0.02\u202fM, the corresponding reflectance is not only smaller in weighted average value but also closer to the highest point of solar spectrum. From Fig. 8b and Figs.8c, it can be seen that the curves corresponding to Ag-ion concentration at 0.02\u202fM always rank in the top especially at shortwave zone. The results of IQE and EQE dramatically decrease during too much deep nanoholes showing up in texturing structure. Electrical parameters of the 156.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f156.75\u202fmm2 solar cells are listed in Table 1 . The efficiency of solar cell calculated as shown in Equation (5) [23,24], where J means photocurrent, V is voltage and Pin describes the incident solar energy current. (5) \u03b7 = J V P i n The solar cell prepared under Ag-ion concentration at 0.02\u202fM shows the highest conversion efficiency (18.94%). It has decent values of all electrical parameters which contribute to its outstanding result. Voc and Rsh values for Ag-ion concentration at 0.05\u202fM and 0.1\u202fM deteriorate due to their chaotically nanotextured front surface. Given the variation of Voc, a trade-off has to be made to get optimum results. The electroluminescence (EL) images of as-fabricated cells indicate values of minority carrier diffusion length by emission intensity [25] and characterize potential recombination defects in the solar cells. Fig. 9 displays similar changing pattern with the minority carrier lifetime of wafers passivated by SiNx. These images become darker implying that deeper nanopores structure is harder to passivate. Further investigating on passivation layer need to be done to make the film and texture more compatible. There are clearly grain boundary on mc-Si wafer of EL image Fig. 9(f). These defects and recombination centers might be induced by improper MACE method and subsequent high temperature steps of solar cell fabrication. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, an economic method to realize proper nanostructured surface on multi-crystalline silicon is presented. In this work, the effects of different Ag-ion concentrations on nanohole structure etching are systematically investigated. Low concentration of Ag-ion followed by shallow nanopores which has bad optical harvesting, while high Ag-ion concentration leads to overcrowded deep nanopores and deteriorates mc-Si solar cell's performances. Deep nanopores have significant negative impact on electrical behaviors which is certified by Sentaurus TCAD simulation and corresponding solar cell efficiency. With a trade-off between reflectance and passivation, a suitable Ag-ion concentration to achieve conversion efficiency about 18.94% on commercial large-area DWS mc-Si wafer had been found. Our work provides stable ways of fabricating DWS mc-Si solar cells with high efficiencies and satisfactory visual appearance. Traditional acidic etching couldn't create low reflectivity structure on DWS mc-Si, but MACE technique could decrease the reflectivity through nanostructure. Compare to the dry etching technique MACE method is low cost wet etching process. Meanwhile, the efficiency of solar cells fabricated by Traditional acidic etching technique has reached the ceiling, and the MACE technique has potential to further improve the performances of solar cells. Further improvement of the cell performance can be realized by optimizing diffusion and passivation.

Due to the intrinsic characteristic of Ag nanoparticles precipitation reaction in solution in the first step of MACE, a large number of deep nanopores are produced on the surface of mc-Si wafer in the following etching step. The deep nanopores can lead to the degradation of mc-Si solar cell's performances. Thus, the influences of Ag-ion concentration in the first step of MACE on the solar cell's performances was carefully studied. It's found that with the increasing of Ag-ion concentration, the light trapping capabilities keeps improving. However, the solar cell's electric performances deteriorate dramatically when Ag-ion concentration reaches to a certain value. Optical and electrical simulation is performed to explain the influences of deep nanopores on the mc-Si solar cell's performances. It is found that there is an optimum Ag-ion concentration value to enhance the mc-Si solar cell's performances, and an efficiency of 18.94% is obtained for large size of 156.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f156.75\u202fmm2 wafer. An absolute efficiency of 0.5% was improved as compared to the conventional acidic textured DWS mc-Si solar cell. It shows the necessity of controlling the Ag-ion concentration in the manufacture of black silicon.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2019-09-15", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927024819303125", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Pengfei"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jia, Rui"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tao, Ke"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jiang, Shuai"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dai, Xiaowan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sun, Hengchao"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jin, Zhi"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ji, Zhuoyu"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Xinyu"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhao, Chongyou"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Hongzhi"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhao, Yaopei"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tang, Lei"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927024819303125"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024819303125"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0927-0248(19)30312-5", "prism:volume": "200", "articleNumber": "109983", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "The influence of Ag-ion concentration on the performance of mc-Si silicon solar cells textured by metal assisted chemical etching (MACE) method", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
