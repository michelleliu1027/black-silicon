In this paper, we report inverted pyramidal nanostructure based multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells with a high conversion efficiency of 18.62% in large size of 156\u00d7156mm2 wafers. The nanostructures were fabricated by metal assisted chemical etching process followed by a post nano structure rebuilding (NSR) solution treatment. With increasing NSR treatment time, the reflectance and the dimensions of micro oval pits were both influenced. Resulting from both the light trapping ability and passivation efficiency, 500nm inverted pyramid structure exhibited an ideal solar cell performance. The best solar cell showed a low reflectivity of 3.29% and a 0.91mAcm\u22122 increase of short-circuit current density, and its efficiency was 0.45% higher than the acid textured solar cell. This technique presented a great potential to be a standard process for producing highly efficient mc-Si solar cells in the future. Keywords Inverted pyramid mc-Si solar cell Metal assisted chemical etching Nanostructure rebuilding 1 Introduction The multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell has dominated the silicon solar cell market due to its low cost. Despite the fact, there is a wide gap between the conversion efficiencies of mc-Si solar cell and the single crystalline silicon (sc-Si) solar cell. Texturization technology might be a crucial factor to narrow the gap in conversion efficiency. With current technology, sc-Si with pyramid structure based on anisotropic alkali etching has a mean reflectance of 10\u201312%, and mc-Si with random pits or wormlike texture based on isotropic acidic etching has a mean reflectance around 25%. Through the anti-reflection layer silicon nitride (SiNx) formed by PECVD, the final mean reflectance of mc-Si solar cell decreased to 9%, in contrast to 3% of the sc-Si solar cell. Therefore, mc-Si had a large promotion space in reducing the reflectance. Black silicon technique has been investigated for decades since it was found by Mazur (Tsing et al., 1998). Three major techniques, which consisted of femtosecond laser technique (Crouch et al., 2004), metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) and reactive ion etching (RIE), showed different nanostructure black silicon (Yoo et al., 2006; Zhong et al., 2015). MACE technique took the lowest cost for its wet chemical process. The excellent light absorbance of black silicon gives a great potential improvement in silicon solar cell conversion efficiency, while the enlarged and defective surface would increase the specific surface area and Auger recombination rate of photogenerated carriers (Oh et al., 2012). Several efforts have been done to change the situation. Although, optimising the nanostructure or improving the passivation technologies seemed to be the effective methods (Liu et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2014; Yue et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015). Alto university combining Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) passivating black silicon technique and IBC solar cell structure together and finally reached the highest reported efficiency of 22.1% (Savin et al., 2015). The cost is still not appropriate with industrial requirements. On the other side, structure optimisation, especially through chemical method, seemed to be more appropriate. Inverted pyramid structure emerged from other nanostructures for its low specific surface area and good antireflective ability (Lu and Barron, 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Toor et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Yang and Lee, 2014; Shi et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2013). The regular configuration of inverted pyramid structure could be accessed by masking film method (Yang and Lee, 2014; Sivasubramaniam and Alkaisi, 2014; Wang et al., 2013). Research on another method has been undergoing in the past years. For upright pyramid structure, anisotropic etching was the formation principle. Pseudo pyramid structure on mc-Si could be accessed by a low concentration of alkaline treatment, and finally a conversion efficiency of 18.45% was obtained (Ye et al., 2014). The anisotropy of alkaline etching needed relative high temperature, and the post rinse was important for cell efficiency. In our previous work, we fabricated a high-efficiency black silicon solar cell with a conversion efficiency of 18.02% by using MACE followed by NaOH post treatment (Yue et al., 2014). In current work, we proposed an acid post treatment method by nanostructure rebuilding (NSR) solution to obtain regular inverted pyramid structure. Formation mechanism of the NSR process was researched. With proper dimension of inverted pyramid structure, high efficiency solar cell was presented. It is expected that Si surfaces with inverted pyramids had a potential for mass production with all chemical processes. 2 Experimental section P-Type mc-Si (200\u00b110\u03bcm thick, 1\u20133\u03a9cm) with standard solar wafer size of 156\u00d7156mm2 were used for this work. The acid texture was taken as a standard process to obtain an oval pit structure and to remove the mechanical damage layer. For two-step MACE method, the wafers were first immersed in the 0.4M HF solution containing 0.002M AgNO3 for 50s. Then, the silver coated wafers were etched in the mixed solution of 0.34M H2O2 and 1.54M HF for 180s to form the nanoholes structure. The as-etched mc-Si wafers were immersed into the solution containing ammonia and H2O2 for 90s to remove the remaining silver particles in the mc-Si. After rinsed in 5wt.% HF and DI water, the structure was restructured in NSR solution (2.52M H2O2 and 0.42M NaF) for different time (30\u2013600s) at 50\u00b0C. The standard process for producing inverted pyramid silicon mc-Si solar cells was: phosphorus diffusion to form p-n junction emitters, PECVD to deposit the SiNx antireflection/passivation layer, and screen printing to metallise top/bottom electrodes. The morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4800). The optical reflectance measurement was carried out by UV\u2013Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600, with an integrating sphere) in the wavelength range of 300\u20131100nm. Micron structure size distribution was analysed by Zeta 3D metrology systems. The quantum efficiency and photovoltaic conversion efficiency of these solar cells were tested by Enlitech QE-R and PVIV-411V systems, respectively. 3 Inverted pyramid nanostructure formation It is well-accepted that the chemical reactions occur near the noble metal when the Si substrate is etched with an etchant consisting of HF and H2O2. In the silicon nanowires fabrication process, the noble metal acts as the catalyst to etch the Si substrate fast in solution with certain oxidants. Since the electrochemical potential of H2O2 is much more positive than the valence band of Si, this is why a bare Si substrate could be etched very slowly in HF/H2O2 (Li and Bohn, 2000). We proposed a more controllable NSR solution to restructure the Si nanowires. It was interesting that strong electrolyte NaF showed better performance than HF during our optimising experiments, which might be due to the relatively high concentration of F-. The whole NSR process could be summarised into to the two reactions that direct Si etching by H2O2 (anisotropic) Yamamoto et al., 1999, and the SiO2 etching by NaF (isotropic): (1) Si + H 2 O 2 \u2192 SiO 2 + H 2 \u2191 (2) SiO 2 + 6 F - + 4 H + \u2192 SiF 6 2 - + 2 H 2 O Because H2O2 has weak acidity so we defined the NSR as an acid process which was different from the alkaline process as in literature (Ye et al., 2014; Yang and Lee, 2014; Shi et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2013). Fig. 1 showed the surface and cross-section SEM images of black silicon by different NSR treatment time. Acid textured mc-Si wafer was used as a substrate for the fabrication of black silicon nanostructure. It can be seen in Fig. 1a that nanoholes were intensively distributed on the micro oval pits with \u3008100\u3009 orientation. The fabricated black silicon with diameters ranging from 50nm to 100nm with the depth of 400\u2013500nm can reduce the reflectivity to below 5%. Obviously, the high surface area of the nanostructure had rough surfaces. It was reported that SiNx by PECVD could not reach the bottom of the nanoholes with high aspect ratio (Liu et al., 2012). With the increase of NSR treatment time, inverted pyramid structure formed step by step. After 100s treatment, Fig. 1c showed that nanoholes were enlarged by interconnecting each other and the flatness of the surface turned out to be better. Furthermore, we found that the bottom of the nanoholes has shown the formation of {111} pyramidal orientation. Accompanied by the depth reduction of nanoholes, the side walls of inverted pyramids formed, as shown in Fig. 1e. Though the depths of nanoholes were different when the black silicon was fabricated, inverted pyramids would interconnect together and form larger ones during the NSR process. Fig. 1g showed regular inverted pyramid structures formed by NSR treatment for 300s, which were in the range of 300nm. It also showed uniform inverted triangle cross section morphology and smooth inverted pyramid surface. As shown in zone A of Fig. 1g, the interconnected structure would overlap and merge into a bigger one. When the NSR treatment time was further increased, larger inverted pyramid structure could be achieved. With longer NSR treatment time, Fig. 1i and k showed inverted pyramid in a range of 500nm and 700nm. The 500nm inverted pyramid structure distributed more uniformly, and less overlapped structure could be seen. The inset image in Fig. 1j showed the 500nm inverted pyramid structure with SiNx passivation layer, which smoothly spread on the surface of inverted pyramid structure that could result in good passivation effect. When the inverted pyramid reaches the range of 700nm, the flat area would emerge as shown in zone B of Fig. 1k. It was interesting to find that NSR wet chemical etching is based on the different etching rates for the (111) and (100) crystallographic planes, which was also in good agreement with the formula (1) and formula (2). The dihedral angels maintained at 54.7\u00b0 (Fig. 1d, f, h, j, and l). 4 Antireflection of inverted pyramid nanostructure Inverted pyramid structure shows better light trapping ability than upright pyramid structure. It was reported that around 37% of incident light experienced a triple bounce on the front surface of the inverted pyramids (Chen et al., 2015). Both the oval pits structure and the inverted pyramid structure would lead to light-harvesting effect due to the strong forward scattering based on Mie theory (Meyer-Arendt, 1995). The light wave diffracted into several beams and partly bounces between the micro/nano structure, preventing light from escaping back to air. For simplicity, we have approximated the change in refractive index as illustrated in Fig. 2 a and b and fixed the refractivity of air and Si to be 1 and 3.4. Although the refractivity changed gradually, the antireflective effect might not be very effective because the feature sizes were much larger than the wavelengths of the light as shown in Fig. 2a. When considering the smaller inverted pyramid structure in Fig. 2b, the geometric dimensioning improved the impedance mismatch of the refractivity from air to silicon, leading to gradually increased effective refractivity (Liu, 2015). Three-dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis was carried out to simulate the reflectance of the inverted pyramid structure. In Fig. 2c, the cross-sectional light intensity distribution was calculated using \u03bb=550nm, which was close to the peak irradiance of the solar spectra. The inverted pyramid was 500nm in width. The obvious fact was that the reflected light intensity above the inverted pyramid-based surface was weak (dark blue 1 For interpretation of color in Fig. 2, the reader is referred to the web version of this article. 1 ) and stronger (shallow blue) light distribution intensity was obtained below the surface. This simulation confirmed the great photon harvesting ability of the inverted pyramid-based silicon surface. With the increase of inverted pyramid dimensions, the average reflectance (400\u2013900nm) increased. It was obvious that as-fabricated black silicon showed the lowest reflectance of 4.90%, while the reflectance increased rapidly with only 100s NSR treatment (150nm inverted pyramid) which might be caused by the elimination of the tiny holes on nanostructure. Then the reflectance showed its linear growth with the increase of inverted pyramid dimensions. For the increasing tendency with enlarging inverted pyramid size (Fig. 3 ), it could be explained by three reasons. Firstly, the feature sizes of the nanostructures are enlarged. Therefore, the light seems to illuminate on inclined silicon surfaces, which resulted in worse destructive interferences (Liu, 2015). Secondly, the inverted pyramids were fabricated on the micro oval pits. Though the oval pits were in micro scales, the whole reflectance would balance on the anti-reflective performance of both structures. Fig. 4 a evaluated the dimension changes (Length (L): the length of the major axis of the surface ellipse; Width (W): the length of the minor axis of the surface ellipse; and Height (H): the depth of the oval pit) of micro oval pits at different stages (stage1/2/3 refer to NSR treatment time 200s/400s/600s). The testing region was 134\u03bcm\u00d7101\u03bcm, and about 1000 micro oval pits were taken into account in each sample. In order to avoid error taken by crystallographic orientation, the same region of the wafer was tested, stage by stage. On account of the sensitivity of 3D optical microscope, the result could simply reflect the dimension changes of micro oval pits. By ignoring the influence of black silicon nanohole structure, the length and width of micro oval pits enlarged. All the tendency indicated that the micro oval pits were enlarged which partially resulted in higher reflectivity in Fig. 3. Fig. 4b schematically presented the formation of an inverted pyramid from a nanohole on micro oval pits. Nanoholes increased the roughness of the surface, and then the NSR treatment engraved inverted pyramidal structure. Fig. 4(\u2461\u2013\u2463) showed the micro oval pits structure surface area reduced during the inverted pyramids forming. With these structure modification processes, the length and width of micro oval pits enlarged, and the height decreased slightly. Thirdly, mc-Si had indeterminacy crystalline orientation. The {111} pyramidal structures on the silicon surface were formed by anisotropic etching in NSR solution. Pyramid derivative structure would form on the surface. It can be seen in Fig. 5 , triangular (Fig. 5a) and groovy (Fig. 5c) structures were distributed on the silicon surface with certain orientation. It was interesting to see that the edge lengths of these structures were in the same range of inverted pyramid with same NSR time. Surface SEM figures (Fig. 5b and d) showed conformal coverage by the SiNx layer. These structures had relative higher reflectivity comparing to the inverted pyramid structure. Considering above mentioned three effects, appropriate inverted pyramidal dimension would b expected from NSR process. 5 Excellent solar cell with inverted pyramid nanostructure Taking both the reflectance and surface structure modulation into consideration, the inverted pyramids with 500nm were chosen for silicon solar cell fabrication. Fig. 6 compared the reflectivity, external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) dependence on wavelengths of acid textured structure and an inverted pyramid structure. Before SiNx coating, inverted pyramid structure could trap more light than acid textured structure, and it had a relatively low reflection of 16.95%. After SiNx layers coating, the reflectance of inverted pyramid structure decreased to 3.29% which had similar optical properties as single crystalline silicon. The average reflectance of SiNx coated acid textured structure was 8.31%, limited by the certain thickness of SiNx layer (ca. 90nm) designed as a quarter-wavelength antireflection coating based on interference effect. After coating with SiNx, inverted pyramid structure particularly decreased the reflectance of short wavelength, leading to an improved spectral response among wavelengths 300\u2013600nm comparing to acid textured structure, as shown in Fig. 6b. Surface defects always cause the IQE deterioration due to the carrier recombination. Since the IQE of the inverted pyramid solar cell was almost close to that of acid textured solar cell, as shown in Fig. 6c, it indicates that the passivation performance of inverted pyramid solar cell was at the same level as that of the acid textured solar cell. Finally, Fig. 6d presented the J-V curves of the inverted pyramid and acid textured solar cells, showing an obvious improvement of Jsc in former. The main characteristics of the two kind solar cells were listed in Table 1 . The efficiency of inverted pyramid solar cell reached to 18.62%, and the Jsc had an increase of 0.91mAcm\u22122. However, Voc had a decrease of 1mV to the 18.17%-efficient acid textured solar cell. The enhanced light absorption was about 5% while the Jsc gain was only 2.54% by calculation, which indicated that recombination was inevitable when using nanostructure. Further improvement in conversion efficiency should be explored for effective restriction of over-doping/Auger recombination and better passivation method. Inverted pyramid structure could be texturized by tank process in an independent machine, and the additional cost could be controlled below $0.033 per cell. Considering about the extra power gain and yearly energy production enhancement (Shi et al., 2013), we believed the technique of MACE had a great potential to become a standard process for producing highly efficient mc-Si solar cells in the future. 6 Conclusions In summary, inverted pyramid structure was fabricated by NSR solution treatment, which was distinguished from other nanostructure rebuilding system. The dimension of inverted pyramid structure could be easily controlled by NSR treatment time. By balancing the light trapping ability and passivation property, large area multi-crystalline silicon solar cells with a size of 156\u00d7156mm2 were fabricated, and a best efficiency of 18.62% was achieved in 500nm inverted pyramid structure with a short-circuit current density increase of 0.91mAcm\u22122. Further improvement of the cell performance can be realized by optimising of NSR treatment (i.e., temperature and concentration) or cell structure.
