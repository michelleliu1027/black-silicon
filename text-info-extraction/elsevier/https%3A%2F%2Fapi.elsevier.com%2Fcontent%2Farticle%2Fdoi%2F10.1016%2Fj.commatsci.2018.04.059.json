Graphical abstract In this article, a structure of heterojunction solar cell configured as Ti (front contact)/p-phosphorene/n-cSi/Ag (back contact) has been simulated by using AFOSR-HET v2.5 software. Here, electronic nature of phosphorene layer which is anisotropic along armchair and zigzag directions has been considered as 3D in nature instead of 2D. After optimizing the parameters of p-type single layer phosphorene and n-type crystalline silicon (n-cSi) maximum power conversion efficiency 15.51% and 14.06% has been achieved for armchair and zigzag phosphorene, respectively. The temperature dependence of the cell performance has been studied and maximum efficiency has been found at 300\u202fK for both armchair and zigzag phosphorene layer. Further, we have studied the effect of metal contact on the cell performance. We have also simulated the solar cell taking experimentally available parameters of n-cSi and efficiencies of 13.29% and 14.06% are found in cases of the armchair and zigzag phosphorene layers, respectively. Finally, we have demonstrated that multilayer p-type phosphorene layer could act as an effective transparent conducting electrode in the silicon heterojunction solar cell. Keywords Phosphorene Silicon heterojunction solar cell AFORS-HET software Transparent conducting electrode 1 Introduction Recently, as a physical analogue to the graphene, single atomic thick layer of black phosphorus (BP) known as phosphorene has emerged as a promising material for next-generation transistor applications due to its superior carrier transport properties. Previously, BP\u2019s instability in the air was considered as a major challenge for its potential application in the devices that operate in an ambient environment [1]. Recently, air stability of BP layers has been improved by depositing an Al2O3 layer on the surface [1,2]. In further advances, it is reported that BP possesses a direct band gap of 0.3\u20132.0\u202feV depending on the layer number and mobility as high as 10,000\u202fcm2/V\u202fs compared to 200\u2013517\u202fcm2/V\u202fs in other 2D materials [3\u20135]. Recently Ge et al. [6] reported that as-synthesized BP is p-type with carrier density 4.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1018/cm3, equivalent to 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1011/cm2 for each layer of BP. Du et al. [7] reported that chemical doping with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) makes the few-layer black phosphorous (FLBP) to p-type. Also, He et al. [8] theoretically predicted that F4-TCNQ enhances the p-type conductivity in single layer phosphorene due to strong charge transfer between its molecule and layer. Furthermore, the sheet resistance of mechanically exfoliated layer has been reported to be in the range of 100\u20131000\u202fk\u03a9/sq and after doping with F4-TCNQ this reduces to 2.5 times [1,7]. Optical absorbance was reported to be 2.8% and 5.5% in single and bilayer phosphorene, respectively confirms its high transparency [9]. The work function of BP decreased rapidly from 5.16\u202feV to 4.5\u202feV as layer number increased from 1 to 5 [10]. Similarly the dielectric constant also increased rapidly from 2.9 (bilayer) to 3.5 (trilayer) [11]. Above discussed properties of FLBP motivates us to use the p-type FLBP in silicon-based heterojunction solar cell as a transparent conducting electrode. Generally, a transparent conducting electrode in the heterojunction solar cell allows the light to pass through the interface and also introduces a built-in potential at phosphorene/Si interface to separate the photogenerated carriers. Recently, application of phosphorene in various areas such as transistors, memory devices, and batteries has been demonstrated [2]. However, the utilization of phosphorene in a solar cell has not been explored much and few reports on the application of phosphorene in solar cell application are available. In 2016, theoretically, Hu et al. [12] proposed that edge-modified phosphorene nanoflakes can act as donor and acceptor materials in heterojunction solar cell and efficiency of 20% has been predicted. Experimentally, liquid phase exfoliated black phosphorous has been used in the organic solar cell. Lin et al. [13] have used the thin layer of phosphorene as anode buffer layer in device structure configured as Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BP/PTB7:PC71BM/Ca/Al. After inserting phosphorene layer, a reduction in efficiency from 7.72% to 6.52% was reported. Thus, optimization of layers\u2019 parameters of phosphorene as well as silicon is required to obtain a cost-effective high-efficiency solar cell. Hence in this report, the cell structure of p-phosphorene/n-cSi under air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) illumination with a power density of 100\u202fW/cm2 using AFORS-HET (Automat FOR Simulation of HETero-structures) software was simulated. This software solves the 1D semiconductor equations-Poisson\u2019s equation and the transport equation for electrons and holes with the help of finite difference under different conditions, i.e. steady state condition, equilibrium condition, etc. In the proposed simulation, we have taken the p-phosphorene as a conducting electrode and n-cSi as an absorber layer. Furthermore, we have considered p-phosphorene 3D in electronic nature instead of 2D. The parameters of both p-phosphorene and n-cSi layers are optimized to obtain the highest efficiency for p-phosphorene/n-cSi solar cell. The simulation was also performed considering the anisotropic nature of phosphorene layer. The objective of the simulation is to study the independent effects of anisotropic behavior of phosphorene as well as Si layer on the performance of the cell and understand the insight behind cell response. 2 Simulation structure As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the structure of heterojunction solar cell configured as Al2O3/Ti/p-phosphorene/n-cSi/Ag has been simulated. In order to prevent the degradation of phosphorene layer in air, capping layer of Al2O3 is employed [1,2] and to minimize the reflection from the layer, its thickness was kept 40\u202fnm [14]. Here Ti [2,15\u201317] and Ag are used as front and back contacts, respectively. Since Lambert-Beer model is applied, which is an in-built feature of the AFORS-HET software, the reflection from the phosphorene/Si interface is not taken into account [18]. The [nk] file for Ti has been created using the data reported by Raki\u0107 et al. [19]. In addition, the reflectance file of Ti has been made using FILMETRIC reflectance calculator software based on the complex matrix form of the Fresnel equation [20]. Absorbance file of Ti has been created using the relations \u03b1x and \u03b1 = 4 \u03c0 k \u03bb , here where x, k and \u03bb is the thickness, extinction coefficient and wavelength, respectively. The in-built file of [nk] for Ag was used for simulation. Details of the front and back contact parameters have been tabulated in Table 1 . In simulated structure, the transport of minority carriers was taken along the c-axis, therefore insulating SiO2 layer was introduced to stop the direct transport of charge carriers between Ti and n-cSi. The Fermi wavelength of the 2D system is given by the relation \u03bb F = 2 \u03c0 n 2 D , where n2D is the carrier density in cm\u22122 [21]. Recently, Saito et al. have reported the sheet carrier density in BP up to 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1013\u202fcm\u22122 [22]. So, if n2D approaches \u223c3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1013\u202fcm\u22122, then \u03bbF is found to be 4.576\u202fnm. Hence, doped six layer phosphorene (\u223c3.96\u202fnm) will satisfy the condition \u3008t\u3009 \u2264\u03bbF, where \u3008t\u3009 is the average thickness for 2D electron system. Therefore, the facts discussed above motivated us to consider multilayer phosphorene as quasi 3D in nature. Here, the quantum confinement was achieved by reducing the thickness. Thickness of single layer phosphorene is fixed at 0.66\u202fnm [10] and [nk] file has been created on the basis of reported values of n and k [23]. Due to anisotropic nature, properties like effective mass and mobility of carriers are different along armchair and zigzag direction [4,10].Thus, the simulation was first carried out considering armchair and then extended for zigzag separately. The variable parameters i.e., acceptor concentration (NA), effective conduction band and valance band density (NC/NV), band gap (Eg), electron affinity (\u03c7), dielectric constant (\u03b5r), electron mobility (\u00b5n), hole mobility (\u03bcp) and layer thickness are optimized. Other values as well as range of the parameters of phosphorene and silicon have been tabulated in Table 2 . The values of NC/NV for phosphorene have been estimated using following equation: (1) N C / V = 2 2 \u03c0 k B Tm e / h \u2217 h 2 3 2 Here kB\u202f=\u202fBoltzmann constant, T\u202f=\u202ftemperature in Kelvin, m\u2217 h \u202f=\u202feffective mass of electrons, m\u2217 e \u202f=\u202feffective mass of holes, h\u202f=\u202fPlanck\u2019s constant [24]. The thermal velocity of carriers has been determined using the relation V th = 3 k B T m e / h \u2217 [25]. In a second step we have further optimized parameters of n-cSi by varying the donor concentration (ND), conduction and valance band density (NC/NV), electron affinity (\u03c7) and thickness. In this simulation work, the range of parameters of p-phosphorene are kept to the reported values in the previous literatures [4,6,10,11,26\u201331]. Similarly, the ranges of parameters of n-cSi layers are taken from the available literatures [32\u201337]. Here we have considered the ranges of the parameters for single crystal Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) [32,33,38] and we have not taken into account the lattice matching between layers. The details of simulation parameters of p-phosphorene and n-cSi are given in Table 2. Schematic of energy band diagram of p-phosphorene/n-cSi interface has been shown in Fig. 1(b). At the interface, electrons are diffused from n-cSi to p-phosphorene and holes from p-phosphorene to n-cSi until thermal equilibrium gets established. During this process, first depletion region forms and then due to the built-in electric field, minority carriers drift in opposite direction. This process continues until the drift current balances the diffusion current, thereby thermal equilibrium is obtained and bending of the energy band near Fermi level occurs. This built-in potential (eV bi ) is also responsible for charge separation in the solar cell. The built-in potential ( e V bi ) in p-phosphorene and n-cSi can be defined in terms of their work function by the following equations: (2) e V bi = \u03a6 p - \u03a6 Si = \u03c7 p + E g ( p ) - - k B Tln N A N V ( p ) - \u03c7 Si + - k B Tln N D N C ( Si ) = E g ( p ) + ( \u03c7 p - \u03c7 Si ) + k B Tln N A N V ( p ) N D N C Si Here \u03a6 p and \u03a6 Si are the work function of p-phosphorene and n-cSi respectively, Eg (p) is the band gap energy of p-phosphorene, \u03c7p and \u03c7Si are the electron affinity of p-phosphorene and n-cSi respectively, kB is the Boltzmann constant, NA and ND are acceptor and donor concentrations, NC and NV are the conduction band density and the valence band density of n-cSi and p-phosphorene, respectively [39]. As p-phosphorene/n-cSi junction is illuminated, electron-hole pairs (EHP) are generated and then separated due to built-in potential. These free minority carriers move towards the p-phosphorene and n-cSi, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Under open circuit condition, these photo-generated carriers enhance the carrier density in the respective regions. Due to the accumulation of these carriers, Fermi level shifts upward in n-cSi and downward in p-phosphorene, respectively and as a consequence VOC develops. Similarly, during short-circuiting photo-generated charge carriers do not accumulate. This happens due to their collocation of carriers at the contact electrode, which results in short circuit current (ISC) in the external circuit. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Optimization and simulation of the p-phosphorene layer (Arm chair direction) In this section, first, we have optimized acceptor concentration (NA) of p-phosphorene layer in the range from 1010 to 1018\u202fcm\u22123 and results were plotted in Fig. 2 (a and b). As shown in Fig. 2b, VOC remained constant at 516.4\u202fmV until NA increased up to 1014\u202fcm\u22123 and then suddenly decreased to 514.8\u202fmV at NA\u202f=\u202f1015\u202fcm\u22123 and remained constant till NA reached to 1018\u202fcm\u22123. Similarly, the short circuit current density (JSC) remained constant for NA up to 1014\u202fcm\u22123 and then JSC decreased from 26.37 to 24.3\u202fmA/cm2. After NA\u202f=\u202f1015\u202fcm\u22123, decrement in JSC became slow. It is reported that at low NA, the mobility of photogenerated carriers remained nearly constant and limited by scattering with phonon while at higher NA mobility was decreased due to the scattering with ionized doping atoms [40]. It is known that carrier\u2019s lifetime depends on mobility given by the relation \u03bc i = e m \u2217 \u03c4 i . Furthermore, as \u00b5i gets reduced, diffusion coefficient (Di) also reduced. The diffusion coefficient, according to the Einstein relation is given as D i \u03bc i = k B e T [24]. Since at higher NA both \u03c4i and Di reduced, consequently diffusion length ( L i = D i \u03c4 i ) reduced. Thus, JSC decreased due to the reduction of Li following the relation: (3) J SC = qG ( L n + L p ) Here Ln and Lp is the diffusion length for electron and hole, respectively and G is carrier generation rate and q is the electric charge of carriers [41]. Further, VOC was found to be constant at 516.4\u202fmV till NA reached to 1014\u202fcm\u22123 and then slightly decreased and became constant at 514.8\u202fmV for higher NA. It is reported that VOC does not depend on NA if condition \u0394 no\u202f\u226b\u202fNA is satisfied, here \u0394 no is the excess electron-hole pairs [35]. Thus VOC remained constant till NA\u202f=\u202f1014\u202fcm\u22123 and is given by the equation: (4) V OC = nqT k ln J SC J 0 + 1 Here n, Jo are ideality factor and reverse saturation current density (mA/cm2), respectively [41]. Jo is defined as: (5) J o = eA D p P n L n + D n n p L p where A is the area of the junction [24]. At NA above 1014\u202fcm\u22123, doping may reduce Li and results in the enhancement of Jo following Eq. (5). This increment in Jo results in a decrement in VOC within the range 1014 to 1015\u202fcm\u22123. Further, for NA above 1015\u202fcm\u22123 Jo increased whereas JSC decreased. This resulted in a reduction of VOC. But at the same time, NA will increase Vbi according to Eq. (2), which leads to increases in VOC. These two processes might give a constant value in VOC after NA\u202f=\u202f1015\u202fcm\u22123. From Fig. 2(a) it was observed that the fill factor (FF) and efficiency (\u03b7) remain constant up to the value of NA\u202f=\u202f1014\u202fcm\u22123 and NA\u202f=\u202f1013\u202fcm\u22123, respectively due to the constant value of VOC and JSC. After NA\u202f=\u202f1014\u202fcm\u22123, there is a sudden increase of FF. This sudden increase may be due to the decrease of VOC and JSC and sheet resistance which reduced due to doping in this range [42]. After NA\u202f=\u202f1015\u202fcm\u22123, the FF decreases slowly. The maximum value of \u03b7 was found to be 7.493% at NA\u202f=\u202f1014\u202fcm\u22123. After optimizing NA to 1014\u202fcm\u22123, the value of NC/NV was optimized within the range 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1015 to 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1018\u202fcm\u22123 as shown in Fig. 2(c and d). It was observed that both VOC and JSC increased linearly with NC/NV. But, according to Eq. (2) both should decrease with the decrease in Vbi. In the present case, both VOC and JSC were found to increase as shown in Fig. 2(d). Increase of VOC can be explained in terms of carrier concentration as V OC = k T q ln n . p n i 2 here ni, n and p are intrinsic, electron and hole concentration, respectively. The n and p can also be written as n\u202f=\u202fno\u202f+\u202f\u0394n and p\u202f=\u202fpo\u202f+\u202f\u0394p, where no and po are concentration of electron and hole in equilibrium. The \u0394n and \u0394p are the excess photogenerated electron and hole. The intrinsic carrier concentration is related with NC and NV as n i = N C N V 1 2 e - E g 2 k T . Thus in this case, nopo\u202f=\u202fni 2, po\u202f=\u202fNA and \u0394n\u202f=\u202f\u0394p, so VOC can be written as V OC = kT q ln 1 + \u0394 n N A + \u0394 n 2 n i 2 + \u0394 nN A n i 2 [43]. Therefore, we can assume that VOC was increased with NC/NV due to an increase of ni. In addition, high NC may lead to high absorption and enhanced JSC [44]. The FF and \u03b7 also found to be increased with NC. The maximum efficiency \u03b7\u202f=\u202f7.645% has been achieved at NC/NV\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1018\u202fcm\u22123. After optimizing NA (1014\u202fcm\u22123) and NC/NV (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1018\u202fcm\u22123) we have optimized band gap (Eg) in the range 0.30\u20131.50\u202feV and results were plotted in Fig. 2(e and f). It is reported that the band gap of phosphorene layer decreased from 1.50\u202feV to 0.595\u202feV as layer number decreased from 1 to 5 [1,4,10]. We observed that as band gap increased up to 1.30\u202feV, VOC as well as JSC increased linearly up to 527.3\u202feV and 26.34\u202fmA/cm2, respectively. This variation in VOC and JSC can be understood from Eqs. (2)\u2013(4). As Eg increases, Vbi also increases {Eq. (2)} and high VOC obtains. The increment in Vbi, separate the photogenerated carriers effectively and enhances JSC. Above Eg\u202f=\u202f1.30\u202feV, VOC decreased to 521.1\u202feV and JSC slightly increased to 26.84\u202fmA/cm2. This decrease in VOC and increase in JSC might happen due to the fact that the doping density NA\u202f=\u202f1014\u202fcm\u22123 shrinks Eg to 1.30\u202feV. In Fig. 2(e). FF increases from 0% to 72.49% as Eg increases to 1.30\u202feV. This increment might be due to the decrease of Jo. Beyond Eg\u202f=\u202f1.30\u202feV, FF decreases to 54%. The decrement in Eg enhances intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) as well as Jo and results in a decrease of FF. Similarly, \u03b7 founds to increase as Eg increases to 1.30\u202feV and further increase of Eg results the decrease in \u03b7. The decrease in \u03b7 might be due to the decrease in VOC and FF. The optimization of \u03c7p was done in the range of 3.6\u20134.1\u202feV as shown in Fig. 2 (g-h). It was observed that as electron affinity increased, first VOC remained constant at 525.8\u202fmV and then decreased abruptly for \u03c7p\u202f>\u202f3.8\u202feV and reached to 157\u202fmV at \u03c7p\u202f\u2248\u202f4.1\u202feV. Similarly, JSC was found to reduce slightly from 26.34 to 25.19\u202fmA/cm2 as \u03c7p increased to 3.9\u202feV and then suddenly decreased to 19.84\u202fmA/cm2 for \u03c7p\u202f=\u202f4.1\u202feV. Considering the band diagram (Fig. 1b) and Eq. (2), these variations can be understood as follows: as \u03c7p increased bottom edge of conduction band bend downward as a consequence Eg(p) decreased. This finally lowered the built-in potential which reduced VOC. This lowering of Vbi decreased the separation of photogenerated carriers to their respective contacts. Thus, JSC also decreased with the increase of \u03c7p. The decrease of FF might be due to recombination of photogenerated carriers and the maximum value of efficiency \u03b7\u202f=\u202f10.04% was achieved at \u03c7p\u202f=\u202f3.6\u202feV. The dielectric constant (\u03b5r) has been reported to increase with layer numbers and has been found to be 2.9, 3.5 and 10.2 for bilayer, trilayer and bulk BP, respectively [11]. Variations of cell parameters with \u03b5r have been studied and plotted in Fig. 2(i and j). VOC decreased from 525.8\u202fmV to 222.7\u202fmV as \u03b5r increased from 2.8 to 10.2. JSC was also found to decrease from 26.34\u202fmA/cm2 to 19.35\u202fmA/cm2. Since Vbi and \u03b5r are inversely proportional and related as V bi \u221d 1 \u03b5 r [24,43], therefore as \u03b5r increased Vbi decreased and resulted in the decrease of VOC as well as JSC. FF and \u03b7 was found to decrease with increase of \u03b5r. The highest efficiency \u03b7\u202f=\u202f10.04% was achieved at \u03b5r\u202f=\u202f2.88. The efficiency and other parameters of the cell are found to be independent of electron mobility (\u00b5n) of the p-phosphorene layer. As reported in Refs. [4,8], the mobility of BP is hole-dominated and reported to be in the order of 10,000\u202fcm2/Vs (in a single layer). Thus, we also studied the response of the cell parameters with hole mobility. As shown in Fig. 2(m and n), as hole mobility increased VOC increased from 503.9\u202fmV to 525.8\u202fmV and JSC from 26.15\u202fmA/cm2 to 26.34\u202fmA/cm2. If mobility will increase then recombination of charge carrier will decrease and \u03c4p, Dp and Lp will increase. Thus VOC enhanced due to Jo whereas JSC due to the increase of Lp. Similarly, FF was found to increase from 52.37% to 72.51%, which might be due to the decrease of Jo. The maximum \u03b7\u202f=\u202f10.04% was achieved at even mobility \u03bcp\u202f=\u202f640\u202fcm2/V\u202fs. After optimizing above-mentioned parameters the simulation was performed by varying the layer number from 1 to 20. It was observed that as the layer number increased VOC slightly decreased from 525.8\u202fmV to 518.2\u202fmV, whereas JSC remarkably decreased from 26.34\u202fmA/cm2 to 14.83\u202fmA/cm2. This might have happened due to lowering of electron-hole pair generation rate which depends on the transmittance of phosphorene. It is reported that as the layer number increased, the transmittance was reduced which resulted in reduced electron-hole pair generation rate. Due to lower VOC, JSC and FF consequently \u03b7 was found to decrease sharply and \u03b7 was decreased from 10.04% to 9.328% as layer number increased from 1 to 20. The FF was reduced due to lowering of sheet resistance which reduced as layer number increased. 3.2 Optimization and simulation of n-cSi wafer After optimizing the parameters of p-phosphorene, the further simulation was carried out to optimize the n-cSi parameters while keeping the parameters of p-phosphorene at their best-optimized values. As shown in Fig. 3 (a and b) it was observed that as ND was increased from 1012\u202fcm\u22123 to 1013\u202fcm\u22123, VOC increased very slightly from 293\u202fmV to 294.1\u202fmV. But for ND\u202f>\u202f1013\u202fcm\u22123 VOC was found to increase linearly and reached up to 655.5\u202fmV. Similarly JSC increased slowly from 0.312\u202fmA/cm2 to 0.356\u202fmA/cm2 as ND increased from 1012\u202fcm\u22123 to 1013\u202fcm\u22123. After ND >1013 cm\u22123, Jsc was increased almost linearly and reached up to 28.66\u202fmA/cm2. Following Eq. (2) high ND enhanced Vbi, which facilitates the movement of generated charge carriers towards their respective electrodes effectively as result VOC and JSC increased. FF and \u03b7 were found to increase with ND. The increment of FF can relate to decrease of the resistivity of the n-cSi substrate [42]. The maximum value of \u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.51% was obtained at ND\u202f=\u202f1017\u202fcm\u22123. After optimizing ND to 1017\u202fcm\u22123 the simulation was further carried out to optimize NC/NV within the range of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u20133\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fcm\u22123 and results have been shown in the Fig. 3(c and d). VOC was found to decrease from 655.5\u202fmV to 597.7\u202fmV with the increase of NC/NV whereas JSC almost remains constant at 28.66\u202fmA/cm2. According to Eq. (2), as NC/NV increases Vbi decreases, thus the trapping of charge carrier inside the silicon layer might be increased. Further increase in NC/NV can directly relate to effective mass (m\u2217) of charge carriers which leads to the decrease of mobility as well as Li of charge carriers according to Eqs. (1), (3) and (4). So Jo increases according to Eq. (5). This decrease in Vbi and increase in Jo decreases the VOC. It has been also reported that NC/NV influences the band gap as well as absorption of photons [44]. From Eq. (3), it can be estimated that at NC/NV\u202f=\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fcm\u22123, the high absorption of photons in active silicon layer increased generation rate of the electron-hole pair (G). However, the high value of G may be further balanced by the lower value of Li consequently leading to a constant value of JSC. FF and \u03b7 were found to decrease linearly up to NC/NV\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fcm\u22123 and then FF slightly enhanced whereas \u03b7 decreased. The initial decrement in FF and \u03b7 may be due to an increase of Jo at NC/NV\u202f>\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fcm\u22123. At higher NC/NV, FF decreases sharply due to its dependence on VOC. Similarly, a linear decrease in \u03b7 is found to depend directly on FF. The highest value of \u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.51% was obtained at NC/NV\u202f=\u202f1019\u202fcm\u22123. After optimization of ND and NC/NV, electron affinity (\u03c7) was optimized within the range of 4.02\u20134.22\u202feV and results are shown in Fig. 3(e and f). VOC, JSC and FF were found to be constant at 653.9\u202fmV, 8.69\u202fmA/cm2 and 82.50%, respectively. This can be attributed to the fact that \u03c7 does not affect the position of Fermi level, thus Vbi does not change. This makes VOC constant. Slight variation in \u03b7 was observed and the maximum value of 15.51% at \u03c7\u202f=\u202f4.22\u202feV was obtained. We have then studied the influence of wafer thickness after optimization of ND, NC/NV, \u03c7. The thickness was varied within the range 10\u202f\u03bcm to 300\u202f\u03bcm. The simulated results are shown in Fig. 3(g and h). We observed that VOC as well as JSC increases linearly as thickness increases from 10\u202f\u03bcm to 50\u202f\u03bcm. VOC increased from 652.3\u202fmV to 655.5\u202fmV and JSC increased from 20.85\u202fmA/cm2 to 28.64\u202fmA/cm2. For thick wafer i.e. >50\u202f\u03bcm, all the cell parameters became constant. The maximum efficiency \u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.37% is achieved at wafer thickness 50\u202f\u03bcm. As Si thickness increases, absorption of photon increases and results in the generation of more electron-hole pairs. Moreover, in thin wafer back contact is close to the depletion region and enhances the collection of photogenerated carriers [45]. Thus VOC and JSC might have improved due to more photon absorption. After thickness >50\u202f\u03bcm, the constant value of JSC might be obtained due to balance between G and Li. It has been reported earlier that the value of VOC become independent of wafer thickness (Wb) if Li\u202f\u226a\u202fWb [46,47]. The maximum value \u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.51% was achieved at 100\u202f\u03bcm of the n-cSi wafer. After optimizing Si parameters the structure was again simulated by varying the layer number of phosphorene from single layer to 20 layers. The results are shown in Fig. 3(i and j), \u03b7 was found to decrease from 15.51% to 13.21% as layer number increased from 1 to 20. To have better practical realization, we have further simulated considering the parameters of commercially available Si. We have taken the value of ND\u202f=\u202f1015cm\u22123, NC\u202f=\u202f2.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fcm\u22123, NV\u202f=\u202f1.04\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fcm\u22123 \u03c7\u202f=\u202f4.05\u202feV, \u03bcn\u202f=\u202f1500\u202fcm2/Vs and \u03bcp\u202f=\u202f450\u202fcm2/Vs for n-cSi as reported in Refs. [37,48]. We have varied the thickness of Si wafer from 10\u202f\u00b5m to 300\u202f\u00b5m. The maximum value of \u03b7 is found 9.83% for 100\u202f\u00b5m thick commercial available n-cSi wafer. In order to study the effect of metal contact, we have simulated our device taking the front contact of Au metal [16,17]. The thickness of Au contact was kept 70\u202fnm and the n and k values are taken as (1.2152, 1.8434) and (0.155, 3.6024) at 480\u202fnm and 650\u202fnm wavelength, respectively [19,49]. In both wavelengths, the efficiencies were found to be 0.1281%. When the thickness of Au contact was reduced to 2\u202fnm, \u03b7 reached up to\u202f\u223c\u202f8% for both wavelengths. This increase in \u03b7 confirms that 2\u202fnm Au contacts absorb less photon and allow the photons transmission through it to reach the junction. But the decrease in \u03b7 from 15.51% (Ti contact) to 0.1218% and \u223c8% (Au contact) might be due to absorption of more photons by Au contact than Ti contact and prevents the photons to pass through it to reach the junction. The further simulation was done by changing the front contact to scandium (n\u202f=\u202f1.1198, k\u202f=\u202f1.1548 at \u223c190\u202fnm wavelength [49]. First, the thickness of this contact was considered 2\u202fnm and achieved \u223c11% efficiency. As this thickness was increased to 10\u202fnm the \u03b7 was found to decrease up to 0.7633%. We have also optimized the cell parameters considering zigzag phosphorene layer and maximum efficiency of 14.06% was achieved (see Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). 4 Spectral response, quantum efficiency and temperature dependence In a solar cell, spectral response (SR) is the ratio of current generated by the solar cell to the optical incident power on the cell and quantum efficiency measures the effects of optical losses such as transmission, reflection etc. through the cell. In order to investigate the spectral response (SR) and quantum efficiencies, simulation was carried out at illumination condition of the monochromatic intensity of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1016\u202fcm2\u202fs\u22121 and 10\u202fnm spectral widths in the range of 300\u20131200\u202fnm as mentioned in software. The spectral response (SR), internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best optimized simulated solar cell (\u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.51%) are shown in the Fig. 4 (a\u2013c). As shown in Fig. 4(a) SR was found to increase from 0.206 to 0.362 A/W as wavelength increased from 300 to 600\u202fnm. Above 600\u202fnm SR decreased and dropped to 0 A/W at 1200\u202fnm. As revealed from magnified Fig. 4(e), photons are absorbed more in 300\u2013600\u202fnm wavelength region which increased JSC in accordance with equation SR = J SC ( \u03bb ) I light ( \u03bb ) , here JSC (\u03bb) is short circuit current density; Ilight (\u03bb) is intensity of the incident light [50]. In a solar cell, IQE refers to efficiency of photons neither reflected nor transmitted out of the cell, whereas EQE includes the effect of optical losses such as reflection and transmission from the cell. In Fig. 4(b and c) IQE and EQE of the best-optimized cell were found to be 0.852 and 0.851 at 300\u202fnm wavelength. The maximum values of IQE and EQE were found to be 0.915 and 0.914, respectively at 400\u202fnm. Above 400\u202fnm both IEQ and EQE were found to be decreased and reached to 0 at 1200\u202fnm. The IQE is defined as IQE ( \u03bb ) = 1 1 - R ( \u03bb ) hc e \u03bb SR , [50] which can also be written as IQE ( \u03bb ) = 1 A ( \u03bb ) + T ( \u03bb ) hc e \u03bb SR , where R (\u03bb) is the reflectivity, h\u202f=\u202fplank\u2019s constant, c\u202f=\u202fvelocity of light, e\u202f=\u202felectric charge \u03bb\u202f=\u202fwavelength of incident light (nm) and following the relation used in the software R (\u03bb)\u202f+\u202fA (\u03bb)\u202f+\u202fT(\u03bb)\u202f=\u202f1, A(\u03bb)\u202f=\u202fabsorptivity and T(\u03bb)\u202f=\u202fTransmittance. Following IQE vs A(\u03bb), T (\u03bb) and SR, the increase of IQE within the range of 300\u2013400\u202fnm is directly proportional to the SR. But above 400\u202fnm the absorption of photons by the phosphorene layer might be increased and resulted in a decrease of IEQ. Similarly, EQE can be defined as EQE = J ( \u03bb ) qF 0 ( \u03bb ) [ 1 - R ( \u03bb ) ] = J ( \u03bb ) qF 0 ( \u03bb ) [ A ( \u03bb ) + T ( \u03bb ) ] , here J (\u03bb) is total current density, F0(\u03bb) is the incident photon density per wavelength interval, q is the total electric charge(q\u202f=\u202fne) [51]. From this equation, it can be estimated that in the wavelength range of 300\u2013400\u202fnm, phosphorene layer might absorb less number of photons and allow them to transmit through it to reach the Si layer, which results in an increase of J as well as EQE. After above 400\u202fnm, the phosphorene layer might absorb a large number of photons and prevents them to reach Si layer. As a result, J (\u03bb) as well as EQE decrease. SR, IEQ, and EQE of best optimized zigzag phosphorene/n-cSi (\u03b7\u202f=\u202f14.06%) solar cell are shown in supplementary Fig. S4(A). In order to study, the temperature dependence of cell response simulation of the best-optimized cell (\u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.51%) was carried out in the temperature range from 300 to 400\u202fK, and the results have been shown in Fig. 5 (a and b). VOC was found to decrease from 655.5\u202fmV to 493\u202fmV whereas JSC was found to increase slightly from 28.66\u202fmA/cm2 to 29.37\u202fmA/cm2 as temperature increases. Since band gap, energy and temperature are related to E g ( T ) = E g ( 0 ) - \u03b1 T 2 \u03b1 + \u03b2 , here Eg (T) is the band gap of the semiconductor at any temperature T, Eg (0) is the band gap energy at T\u202f=\u202f0 Kelvin, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the material constant [41]. According to E-T relation as mentioned above, as temperature increases band gap decreases. It is also reported that Jo increased as temperature increased [41] and resulted in decrease of VOC. In addition, at lower Eg large numbers of absorbed photons have enough energy to create e-h pairs and JSC gets increased. The FF and \u03b7 are found to decrease due to decrease of VOC. The maximum efficiency \u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.51% is found at temperature 300\u202fK. Optimized cell parameters have been summarized in Table 3 . The variation of parameters with temperature of the best optimized zigzag phosphorene and n-cSi is shown in supplementary Fig. S4(B). 5 Conclusions In order to develop a cost-effective heterojunction Si solar cell, the structure Ti/p-phosphorene/n-cSi/Ag has been proposed and simulated using AFROS-HET-v2.5 software to optimize the layer's parameters. Effect of eight parameters of phosphorene was analyzed individually. After optimizing parameters of phosphorene (arm-chair) and n-cSi wafer maximum efficiency \u03b7\u202f=\u202f15.51% was achieved whereas \u03b7\u202f=\u202f14.06% in case of zigzag. Our simulation reveals that the efficiency does not depend much on anisotropic nature of phosphorene. Simulated results demonstrate that if the stability of phosphorene in the air can be controlled then it can act as an efficient transparent electrode in the silicon heterojunction solar cell.

Here, electronic nature of phosphorene layer which is anisotropic along armchair and zigzag directions has been considered as 3D in nature instead of 2D. After optimizing the parameters of p-type single layer phosphorene and n-type crystalline silicon (n-cSi) maximum power conversion efficiency 15.51% and 14.06% has been achieved for armchair and zigzag phosphorene, respectively. The temperature dependence of the cell performance has been studied and maximum efficiency has been found at 300\u202fK for both armchair and zigzag phosphorene layer. Further, we have studied the effect of metal contact on the cell performance. We have also simulated the solar cell taking experimentally available parameters of n-cSi and efficiencies of 13.29% and 14.06% are found in cases of the armchair and zigzag phosphorene layers, respectively.
