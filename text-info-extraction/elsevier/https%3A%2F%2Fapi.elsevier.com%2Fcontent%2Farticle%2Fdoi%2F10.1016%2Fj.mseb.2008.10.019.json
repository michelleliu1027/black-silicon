Front surface texturing processed by wet or dry etching improves efficiencies of solar cells, due to reduced reflection and light trapping with antireflection coatings. Random reactive ion etching (RIE) techniques are very effective for application with low-cost, large area crystalline silicon solar cells. In this paper, we studied a SF6/O2 RIE process without mask texturing of silicon. By this process, pyramids of needle-like structure (with diameters ranging from 50nm to 70nm) were formatted by local and regenerating oxide masking and inhomogeneous etching. After the RIE process, we also investigated damage removal etching (DRE) as a function of the etching time to determine which produced the highest cell performance for screen-printed cell fabrication sequences. Crystalline silicon solar cells fabricated in a conventional industrial production line applying optimized film deposition and annealing conditions on a large area substrate (125mm\u00d7125mm) had conversion efficiencies as high as 15.1%. Keywords Light trapping Reactive ion etching Solar cell Damage removal etching 1 Introduction The performance of a solar cell is a critical function of its internal quantum efficiency (IQE), which determines the relative percentage of photo-generated electron\u2013hole pairs (EHPs) lost to recombination after considering reflection losses [1]. Therefore, the texturing of front surfaces on crystalline silicon solar cells is mostly performed for improvement of the cell efficiency, by means of its antireflection properties and light trapping. Also, it was historically obtained by creating randomly distributed pyramids using anisotropic etchants, but this has an application to single crystalline silicon due to its crystallographic orientation. Recently, various forms of texturing were tried on a crystalline silicon surface including laser-structuring [2], mechanical diamond saw cutting [3], photo-lithographically defined etching [4], porous-Si etching [5,6], and mask-less reactive ion etching (RIE) which results in so-called \u201cBlack silicon\u201d [7]. The surface structure of black silicon for application with solar cells fabrication is formed by varying the SF6/O2 flow rate. RIE using SF6/O2 plasma can provide high rates of isotropic etching. It is possible to vary the etch directionality between isotropic and anisotropic, while Cl2 yields lower etching rates but provides much better profile control. Black silicon texturing is based on local and regenerating oxide masking. In the first stage, the silicon surface is covered with native oxide. This layer serves as the masking layer. It is not removed homogeneously, but is perforated first. Unmasked spots are etched and random pyramids with needle-like structure are formed on the silicon surface [8]. In SF6/O2 plasma etching, SF6 gas was used to intentionally form F* radicals to etch the silicon by producing volatile SiF4. Also, oxygen produces O* radicals for passivation of the silicon sidewall surface with Si x O y F z which helps to control etch profiles [9]. After RIE process, chemical wet damage removal etching (DRE) is necessary for improving the lifetime of silicon materials. A high minority carrier lifetime is an indication of low defect concentration and is essential for obtaining high collection efficiency. Also, the effective carrier lifetime (\u03c4 eff) depends on the bulk minority charge carrier lifetime (\u03c4 bulk) and the surface recombination velocity (S eff). In this work, we performed RIE using SF6/O2 for the formation of black silicon, which improves the antireflection and light trapping properties of crystalline silicon solar cells with minimal surface damage. 2 Experimental For the solar cells fabrication, a p-type solar grade Cz\u2013Si wafer of size 125mm\u00d7125mm (pseudo square) was used. The RIE system using silicon surface texturing is based on a combination of chemical activity of reactive species generated in the plasma with physical effects caused by ion bombardment. The silicon wafer to be etched was positioned on a water cooled (\u226420\u00b0C) power electrode of a parallel plate reactor that was powered by a 13.56MHz RF generator. Therefore, negative DC bias is generated in the sample placed on the electrode by applying RF power and exposing the wafer to bombardment with positive ions (with energies below 700V) during RIE. The reaction gases consisted of a mixture of SF6 and O2, which were introduced into the process chamber. SF6, though chemically stable, can be induced to dissociate in a gas discharge and the generated fluorine ions are useful for etching purposes. For silicon surface texturing, the gas ratio (SF6/O2) was 0.5\u20134.3, the working pressure range was 143\u2013302mT and the etching time was 5\u201320min with 100W RF power. Also, the electrode gap was controlled at 5\u20137cm to ensure uniformity of the textured silicon surface. After the RIE process, we performed DRE to determine which produced the highest cell performance for screen-printed metal cell fabrication. Samples were treated by dipping them in a mixed acid chemical for 10\u201360s at room temperature. The textured surface was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The silicon surface reflection was examined by a UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer (SCINCOS\u20132100) using an integrating sphere in the range of 220\u2013850nm. High-frequency C\u2013V (capacitance\u2013voltage) measurements were performed using a HP4912 impedance analyzer. Silicon wafers were doped with an n-type impurity in an open tube furnace using conventional POCl3 diffusion source at 860\u00b0C with a 20min pre-deposition followed by a 40min drive-in. Phosphosilicate glass (PSG) was removed using a 5% HF solution. Edge isolation was performed with a mixture solution of HF, HNO3 and CH3COOH in suitable proportions. A SiN x :H film of thickness 730\u00b110\u00c5 and refractive index 2.24 was deposited by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. The screen printing metallization technique was used for high throughput metal contact formation using aluminum (Al) paste and silver (Ag) paste on the back surface and front surface, respectively. These metal pastes were dried at 150\u00b0C for 5min. The optimized temperature profile for co-firing the solar cell was 500\u2013700\u2013800\u2013920\u00b0C for the set temperature of the four defined zones of the belt furnace used in this study, at a belt speed of 137in./min. The illuminated current\u2013voltage characteristics and performance parameters of the solar cells fabricated by the SiN x :H film with optimized properties were determined under a one sun global solar spectrum of air mass (AM) 1.5 at 25\u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion In terms of the variation of silicon etch rate as a function of working pressure, it was found that etch rate rapidly increases from 144nm/min to 742nm/min in the range of 143\u2013302mT. The average reflectance in the range \u03bb =300\u2013850nm increases from 8.4% to 36.3%. The plasma density generally increases with respect to increasing working pressure for a fixed gas ratio and decreases with the mean free pass of radicals. Therefore, SF6 and O2 gases generate more F* and O* radicals, which are involved in silicon etching and silicon sidewall passivation. Thus, increased O2 at higher chamber pressures results in O* radicals which passivate the silicon sidewall surface with Si x O y F z . This helps to control etch profiles. The large quantity of SF6 produces F* radicals for chemical etching of silicon by generating volatile SiF4 [10]. As shown in Fig. 1 , a silicon surface, which is used for RIE texturing as the function of gas ratio (SF6/O2), has an etch rate from 47nm/min to 456nm/min. The reflectance of textured silicon with respect to the gas ratio equals 40.45%, 17.61%, 10.29%, and 30% for a sample with a gas ratio of 0.5, 1.5, 2.8, and 4.3, respectively. As F* radicals produced by SF6, which are used for chemical etching of silicon by forming volatile SiF4, show an insufficient reaction at a SF6/O2 gas ratio of 0.5, the etch rate is very low and reflectance is very high similar to the surface of bare silicon as shown in Fig. 2(a). However, the pyramids with crater-like structure with same pattern of 0.2\u20130.6\u03bcm are formed on the silicon surface at a SF6/O2 gas ratio of 1.5 (Fig. 2(b)). Fig. 2(c) shows the pyramids with needle-like structure which results in so-called \u201cblack silicon\u201d. Therefore, the low reflectance of a black silicon surface using mask-less RIE etching is due to dense pyramid, which improves light trapping. Under the plasma condition shown in Fig. 2(d), pyramids with needle-like structure are distributed over a wide area. A high SF6/O2 gas ratio is necessary for increasing the etch rate, but the sidewall passivation of O* radicals is reduced by means of a decrease in O2. Based on these results, we can determine that the SF6/O2 gas ratio of 2.8 is suitable for the formation of a black silicon surface with a dense and uniform surface structure. Fig. 3 shows the reflectance and thickness of etched silicon as a function of etching time. The etch rate is very low due to the initial native oxide layer. But, after an etching time of 2min 30s, the thickness of etched silicon increases rapidly from 0.2\u03bcm to 9.8\u03bcm and the reflectance decreases from 33% to 6% by varying the etching time. The initial silicon surface is generally covered with thin native oxide. This layer, which performs the masking, is not eliminated homogeneously [11]. Thus, unmasked areas are etched and pyramids with needle-like structure, which depend on the degree of isotropy of the etching process, are formed as shown in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4(a), high density pyramids with needle-like structure of size 50\u201370nm are obtained. Pyramids which are vertically formed by sidewall passivation of the Si x O y F z layer and etching have greater variation in depth and size as shown in Fig. 4(b). To verify that the lifetime of silicon material is improved by the DRE process with respect to the decrease of surface recombination, this process was performed with a mixed acid chemical (HF, HNO3, CH3COOH) for RIE textured samples over 10min. The reflectance of the black silicon surface increases from 10.29% to 11.77% with respect to the DRE time. Fig. 5 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of solar cells fabricated by samples with No DRE and 60s DRE time, after 10min RIE texturing. At all range of wavelength, EQE of sample which is treated with 60s DRE time is higher than that of the sample processed with No DRE. This process improves the loss of surface recombination at short wavelengths and light absorption at long wavelengths. Therefore, in contrast to the increase in the reflectance of the black silicon surface, it is very important for the DRE process to improve EQE properties indicating successful light trapping. SiN x :H films which are deposited with a refractive index of 2.24 at 450\u00b0C with gas ratio (R=NH3/SiH4 +NH3) of 0.57 served as an antireflection and passivating layer in solar cells. After SiN x :H films were deposited on RIE textured samples for 10min, MIS capacitance structures formed and annealed between 600\u00b0C and 800\u00b0C for application with the firing process of screen-printed metal cell fabrication sequences. Interface trap density (D it) was calculated from C\u2013V data. A graph of D it with respect to DRE time is shown in Fig. 6 . In both annealing samples, D it of the sample improves by increasing the DRE time. Compared with the annealed sample at 600\u00b0C, D it of it at 800\u00b0C is from 8.3\u00d71011 cm\u22122 eV\u22121 to 1.86\u00d71011 cm\u22122 eV\u22121 as a function of the DRE time. Also, the higher the surface damage caused by the RIE process, the greater the improvement in D it at annealing temperature of 800\u00b0C. Thus, the DRE process and SiN x :H passivation at high temperature for silicon surface damage by the RIE process are effective for improving D it properties, due to the low recombination rate at the interface. Electrical performance parameters of solar cells with respect to the DRE time are shown in Fig. 7 . As the DRE process with RIE for 10min is performed over increasing time, the current density increases from 30.3mA/cm2 to 32.52mA/cm2 with reformation of shunt resistance. Open circuit voltage (Voc) increases from 596mV to 611mV. The fill factor is improved by about 2% (75\u201377%) by damage removal on the black silicon surface as a result of the decrease in series resistance. Compared with the sample of No DRE, the conversion efficiency of 15.1% is obtained for black silicon solar cells under the condition of a 60s DRE time. These results are comparable to a 16.2% conversion efficiency of cells fabricated with a silicon wafer using SDR and NaOH texture. 4 Conclusion A comprehensive study on plasma texturing, which is substituted for wet-chemical treatment prior to diffusion, was performed to optimize conditions for black silicon solar cells application. The pyramids of needle-like structure of about 50\u201370nm size were inhomogeneously generated by an initial native oxide and SF6/O2 plasma and treated by maintaining a working pressure of 182mT and SF6/O2 gas ratio of 2.8 for improvement of light trapping. After the RIE process, we performed DRE to determine which produced the highest cells performance for screen-printed solar cells fabrication. By this process, it shows the best values of conversion efficiency (Eff), fill factor (FF), current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage of the cell as 15.1%, 77, 32.52mA/cm2, and 611mV, respectively. Further improvement in black silicon solar cell performance is expected using suitable optimization of the parameters of cell fabrication. References [1] A.L. Fahrenbruch R.H.
