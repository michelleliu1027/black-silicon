Introduction For increasing the efficiency of the solar cells via efficient utilization of the solar spectrum, the reflection loss on the top surface of the absorber layer needs to be significantly reduced. For crystalline silicon solar cells it appears absolutely essential as the reflection loss is significantly high, nearly 30%. Generally quarter wavelength transparent layers [1] of SiOx, Si3N4, or TiOx, ZnO and In2O3:Sn (ITO) are used as ARCs on silicon solar cells [2,3]. For rystalline silicon wafers formation of a self anti-reflection surface texture without masking could be an efficient approach; such structures are called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlack Silicon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 [4].

However, plasma chemical process is relatively clean and well controllable. Among various PECVD systems, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) PECVD is most effective to produce high density and uniform plasma at a low gas pressure [5,6]. The basic objective of the present work is to produce black silicon by reactive ion etching of single crystal silicon wafers at various temperatures, by H2 plasma created at various gas pressures in ICP-PECVD. 2. Experiments Slightly doped p\u00e2\u20ac\u201ctype (100) silicon wafers were cleaned by dipping in HF (5% molar) for 30 second and subsequently sonicated sequentially in acetone, alcohol and distilled water. Silicon wafers with cleaned surface was etched by a stream of H2-plasma generated by 500 W of RF (13.56 MHz) power applied to the low inductance (0.54 \u00c2\u00b5H) four antenna planer spiral copper tube coil in planer inductively coupled plasma chemical vapour deposition system (ICP\u00e2\u20ac\u201cCVD) [7,8]. The base vacuum of chamber was maintained at 9\u00c3\u201410\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 Torr. Two sets of etched samples were prepared by varying the gas pressure in the plasma from 30 to 150 mTorr and changing the wafer temperature from 200 to 450 \u00c2\u00b0C, keeping others deposition parameters fixed. An optimum two hours of exposure time is maintained in each case [9]. The optical reflection data of the etched samples were obtained in the UV\u00e2\u20ac\u201cvisible region at room temperature, using a double beam spectrophotometer (Hitachi U\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4100 spectrometer, Japan). The changes in surface morphology of the etched samples were pursued by Veeco (di CP\u00e2\u20ac\u201cII) atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker AXS, Mannheim, Germany) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSEM; JEOL JSM\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6700F). 3. Results and Discussion The 1st set of etched samples were obtained by maintaining the wafer temperature at 450 \u00c2\u00b0C and reducing the H2 gas pressure (p) in the plasma chamber from 150 to 30 mTorr. Fig. 1(a) shows the reflectance spectra of the corresponding samples over 250 to 800 nm wavelength (visible region). It is evident that the entire reflection spectrum from the sample surface reduced significantly on the introduction of plasma etching on bare Si; at an wavelength of 500 nm the reflectance (R500) reduced from 28.37% for the bare Si to 15.29% for the sample etched at p =150 mTorr. On further reduction in the chamber pressure, R500 reduced monotonically to ~2.61% at p =30 mTorr, producing virtually the black silicon (b\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSi). Reduction of pressure below 100 mTorr led to a minimal decrease in reflectance because significantly increased collision of ionic species at very low pressure caused striking changes in the surface morphology, as shown by microscopic surface analysis in a later section. Fig. 1. (a) Changes in the reflectance spectra of etched Si wafers at 450 \u00c2\u00b0C temperature with different gas pressure in the plasma. Spectrum of an untreated bare Si wafer is shown for reference. (b) The variation of reflection spectra of etched silicon wafers at different substrate temperature with 30 mTorr gas pressure in the plasma. 1326 D. Das and L. Karmakar / Materials Today: Proceedings 18 (2019) 1324\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1328 The effect of further changes of temperature (TE) of the samples during etching was studied on the 2nd set of samples maintained at the gas pressure, p =30 mTorr. It is evident from Fig. 1(b) that the corresponding magnitudes of R500 further reduced for samples etched at lower TE. The magnitude of R500 as low as 0.13%, for the sample etched at TE =200 \u00c2\u00b0C, appears remarkably low, making it as an ideal active material for solar cell applications. The surface morphologies of the 1st set of samples, obtained from AFM study, are shown in Fig. 2(a,b,c) and the corresponding FESEM micrographs are presented in Fig. 2(d,e). It has been identified that H2 plasma etching appears more significant and uniform at a lower gas pressure in the plasma [10,11]. At lower pressure reduced multiple collision of the ionic and atomic constituents minimizes the energy loss by collision, and the corresponding longer mean free path enables the ionic and atomic constituents to interact with the c-Si surface with a higher velocity and energy, resulting in a significant etching rate. Multiple internal reflections within the micro-structured etched surface induce light trapping and subsequent minimization of reflection loss for visible solar spectrum for the etched samples prepared at lower plasma pressure at 30 mTorr. Fig. 2. AFM morphology of silicon nanostructures surface etched at 450 \u00c2\u00b0C with varied gas pressure( p) in the plasma at (a) 150 mTorr (b) 100 mTorr and (c) 30 mTorr and the corresponding FE\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSEM images of samples at (d) 150 mTorr and (e) 30 mTorr. Fig. 3(a) shows the AFM micrograph and Fig. 3(b) presents the FESEM surface morphology of the sample from the 2nd set, prepared at the a lower temperature TE =200 \u00c2\u00b0C with lower gas pressure in the plasma chamber, p =30 mTorr. It is notably observed that the etched surface is remarkably uniform in a typical pyramid like structure with a size distribution. In order to meet the requirement of destructive interference, the product of refractive index (n) and thickness (d) of the anti-reflection coatings (ARC) needs to maintain the quarter wavelength relation with the incoming wave, following [1]: d = \u00ce\u00bb/4n (1) Now, considering the refractive index of nano-crystalline silicon, n ~3.5, and a span of wavelength of visible light around 400 to 700 nm, the optimum dimension of ARC could vary from 30 to 50 nm. D. Das and L. Karmakar / Materials Today: Proceedings 18 (2019) 1324\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1328 1327 At higher surface temperature vigorous plasma etching produces uncontrolled step-like surface features, particularly at lower pressure where the energy of the ionic species increases very rapidly, while mild plasma etching rate at lower temperature produces, in a controllable manner, the high density, homogeneous as well as uniform pyramid like Si-nanostructures with dimension varying from 40 nm to 200 nm which closely resembles with the requirement to satisfy the condition of anti-reflection coating (ARC) [12-16]. An extremely low reflection (~0.13%) from the optimally etched silicon nanostructures prepared by plasma etching at 200 \u00c2\u00b0C temperature has been attained. Coherent light trapping after multiple internal reflections within the uniformly shaped pyramidal nano-structured surface promote minimization of reflection loss to ~0.13% of the visible spectrum, thereby, turning it towards an ideal active material for solar cell applications. Fig. 3. The (a) AFM morphology and (b) FE\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSEM image of pyramid like Si-nanostructures prepared at 200 \u00c2\u00b0C temperature and 30 mTorr gas pressure in the H2 plasma. 4. Conclusions Significant reduction in reflection loss from the top surface of the crystalline silicon absorber layer is an urgent requirement for increasing the efficiency of the solar cells. Present manuscript deals with the development of almost black-Si by H2 plasma etching of the c-Si wafers, using planar inductively coupled plasma CVD and working in the 30 to 150 mTorr gas pressure range and within 200 to 450 \u00c2\u00b0C span of temperature of the wafers. Etched samples have been characterized by the measurement of reflectance and the scanning of the surface features by Atomic Force Microscopy and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. Lower gas pressure in the plasma influences efficient etching of the Si surface. At higher temperature of the c-Si wafer vigorous plasma etching occurs and that produces uncontrolled step-like surface features which demonstrate reduced reflection loss. With lower temperature plasma etching, on the other hand, high density, homogeneous and uniform pyramid like Si-nanostructures are produced. At 200 \u00c2\u00b0C and 30 mTorr gas pressure in the plasma, pyramid like Si-nanostructures with dimension ~40 to 200 nm are obtained that closely satisfies the anti-reflection coating (ARC) requirement and delivers extremely low reflectance ~0.13% which appears most useful for solar cell applications.

Present research targets on producing almost black-Si by H2-plasma etching of the c-Si wafers, using planar inductively-coupled plasma-CVD. It is demonstrated that lower gas pressure in the plasma promotes efficient etching of c-Si surface. Plasma etching at 30 mTorr and 200 \u00b0C produces, high-density, homogeneous and uniform pyramid-like Si-nanostructures with dimension \u223c40\u2013200 nm which closely satisfies the anti-reflection coating (ARC) requirement. An extremely low reflection (\u223c0.13%) from such optimally etched silicon nanostructures appears most useful for photovoltaic applications", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2019-12-31", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214785319319698", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Das, Debajyoti"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Karmakar, Laxmikanta"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214785319319698"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785319319698"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S2214-7853(19)31969-8", "prism:volume": "18", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "Minimization of Reflection-Loss from Etched Nano-structures of Silicon Crystal Wafers", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
