Tel.: +86 21 66136901; fax: +86 21 66136907. Nanoporous black silicon (nb\u2013Si) structures with/without saw damage removal (SDR) on solar-grade multi-crystalline silicon substrates have been formed by simple Ag-induced chemical etching. The nb\u2013Si shows a unique morphology of nano-scale holes on micron-scale patterns with low reflectance (<5%). The photovoltaic properties of nb\u2013Si solar cells show that SDR process prior to Ag-induced chemical etching is an effective way to lower recombination and ohmic losses, resulting in significant efficiency enhancement of 26.0%. To further reduce the recombination loss for the nb\u2013Si solar cells with \u223c10% efficiency, a two-layer emitter model has been introduced to explain the reduced emitter diffusion length that significantly lower spectral response. This suggests that removing residual Ag nanoparticles completely might be the key approach to enhance the spectral response of nb\u2013Si solar cells with very low surface reflectance, thus increasing the final conversion efficiency. Keywords Nanoporous silicon Silver nanoparticle Multicrystalline silicon Recombination loss Solar cell modeling 1 Introduction Optical loss caused by high reflectance of manufactured silicon wafers is critical to limit the conversion efficiency of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. Traditional anisotropic/isotropic chemical etching [1\u20133] is a common approach to produce mass c-Si solar cells in industry. Besides, antireflection coatings (ARC) such as SiN x and SiO x could strongly suppress the reflectance in certain wavelength. However, even with the best chemical etching and ARC, c-Si solar cells still show relatively high reflectance, thus suppressing conversion efficiency of c-Si solar cells. To lower the surface reflectance and increase light-induced current density, several physical mechanism models have been reported, such as multiple reflections [4], an intermediate band within band gap of silicon [5], subwavelength structures [6], and gradual modulation of effective refractive index [7]. Recently, many corresponding experimental methods, including electrochemical etching [8,9], reactive ion etching [1,10], plasma texturization [11,12], laser texturing by femtosecond pulses [13\u201315] and metal-induced chemical etching [16\u201319], have been investigated. Among these, metal-induced chemical etching is a promising method for surface texturing, owing to its simple wet chemical process to produce nanoporous black silicon (nb\u2013Si) with very low surface reflectance (<5%). The metal-induced chemical etching has been applied to fabricate c-Si solar cells. By combining the wet chemical etching process with deposited Au nanoparticles by thermal evaporation on c-Si wafers, Koynov et al. [20] made black multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells, resulting in increasing short-circuit current density (J sc ) about 36\u201342%. Then, Branz et al. [18] simplified the black silicon surface processing on float zone (FZ) c-Si substrates by not using the expensive vacuums and pumps, but introducing one-step etching, i.e. mixing Au deposition and etching process together. Their black Si solar cell demonstrated an enhancement of more than 35% in J sc and conversion efficiency of 16.8% over a planar control without anti-reflection [21]. Recently, Nishioka et al. [22] chose nano-sized Ag particles, instead of nano-sized Au ones, as catalytic nanoparticles because Au makes a deep trap for carriers in silicon and costs too much. Moreover, it was also reported by Lin et al. [23] that nanotexturing technique with Ag particles was applied to fabricate c-Si solar cells. However, three challenges remain for optimizing nb\u2013Si solar cell performance. First, complex solar cell manufacturing procedures [20], high quality FZ c-Si as raw materials [21] and Ag nanoparticles precisely controlled by polyethylenimine protected colloids [22] are costly for industrial applications. Second, some research groups [20,23] mentioned that saw damage removal (SDR) before metal-induced chemical etching was favorable for nb\u2013Si; however, no further explanations were discussed. Finally, deep and comprehensive understanding on photovoltaic properties, especially the recombination loss, was almost devoid in nb\u2013Si solar cells although Yuan et al. [21] has proposed a modeling method for single-crystal FZ nb\u2013Si solar cells. In this work, we employed a simple Ag-induced chemical etching process to make nb\u2013Si structure on solar-grade mc-Si substrate [24]. Although SDR seems necessary for traditional manufacturing process for c-Si solar cells, it remains unknown for nanoporous structures of mc-Si because traditional isotropic chemical etching is deprived of SDR beforehand. Thus, the nb\u2013Si samples with/without SDR prior to Ag-induced chemical etching were fabricated. With very low surface reflectance during the process from materials to devices, the two types of nb\u2013Si samples/solar cells were investigated in detail. Finally, the modeling and potential optimizations of nb\u2013Si solar cells were studied to further reduce the recombination loss while retaining the advantage of low optical loss. 2 Experimental details The substrates used were neighboring solar-grade mc-Si wafers in the middle part of ingot from Konca Solar Cell Co. Ltd (p-type, 1\u20133\u03a9cm, 200\u00b120\u03bcm thick). Cut into 50mm\u00d750mm, the wafers were first cleaned in acetone at room temperature (RT) for several minutes. SDR was then carried out by etching in 40% HF: 65\u201368% HNO3 (1:10) at 5\u00b0C for 3.5min. For comparison, some samples without SDR were also prepared. After immersing the wafers in an aqueous 0.004mol/L HF and 0.32mol/L AgNO3 etching solution at RT for several seconds to deposit Ag nanoparticles, chemical etching was carried out in a 1:5:10 mixture of 40% HF, 30% H2O2, 65\u201368% HNO3 at RT for 3min. Finally, to remove residual Ag particles, the samples were immersed in 65\u201368% HNO3 solution and rinsed with de-ionized water. After this defined Ag-induced chemical etching, nb\u2013Si structure was formed on the surface of mc-Si. It should be noted that in the entire fabrication process, the experimental conditions such as the ratio and duration for Ag deposition, the etching solution, and the etching time have been optimized to obtain the nb\u2013Si with the low surface reflectance and uniformly etching morphology. Nb\u2013Si solar cells were fabricated from the nb\u2013Si samples by applying a standard c-Si solar cell manufacturing process. After pre-cleaning, n-type emitters were formed by phosphorus diffusion from PClO3 at 860\u00b0C. The sheet resistance for nb\u2013Si was attained to be 31.0\u201333.0\u03a9/\u25a1 while SDR sample\u2019s sheet resistance was 40\u03a9/\u25a1 as control. The edge isolation was performed by fluorocarbon barrel plasma etching in plasma equipment and phosphorus silicate glass (PSG) was removed in diluted HF solution. Then SiN x , as ARC and passivation layer, was deposited on the n-type emitter layer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Al back surface fields were applied to reduce the back surface recombination velocity by using aluminum paste (Rutech RX8204) while front grid electrodes were printed by silver paste (Ferro NS33-512). Finally, good ohmic contact was obtained by rapid thermal process. The whole manufacturing process for nb\u2013Si samples without/with SDR was summarized in Table 1. To simplify our description, nb\u2013Si samples without/with SDR are denoted as nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B, respectively. The morphologies of the samples were observed by using scanning electron microscopes (SEM) (Hitachi SU-1510 & JEOL JSM-6700F). The average reflectance of those samples during each manufacturing process over the spectral range from 300 to 850nm was measured by an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Persee TU-1901). The minority carrier lifetimes of samples were measured by using the microwave photoconductivity decay (\u03bc\u2013PCD) from a wafer tester (Semilab WT-2000). The photovoltaic properties of nb\u2013Si solar cells were characterized by current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) measurements either in the dark or under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) illumination at 25\u00b0C by a source meter (Keithley Series 2400) and a solar simulator (Sciencetech SS1k). The reflectance and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of nb\u2013Si solar cells over the wavelength ranging from 300nm to 1200nm were tested by a comprehensive optoelectronic analysis system. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Optical and structural properties of nb\u2013Si materials Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of bare silicon, silicon after SDR, nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B, respectively. Before SDR process, the bare silicon shows the typical morphology due to the saw damage caused by the wire slicing process, in which the thick ingots were cut into solar-grade mc-Si wafers (Fig. 1a). After Ag-induced chemical etching, the nano-scale holes are found uniformly on micron-scale pit etching surfaces in the nb\u2013Si\u2013A (Fig. 1c). Comparatively, after SDR process, silicon shows the uniform surface with crystal orientation (Fig. 1b). Also, the effective minority carrier lifetime has dramatically increased from 1\u20132\u03bcs to \u223c32\u03bcs (both sides passivated by iodine before measurements). After Ag-induced chemical etching, the nb\u2013Si\u2013B shows that the nano-scale holes with less roughness and depth are distributed uniformly on micron-scale inverted triangle etching surfaces (Fig. 1d). In the enlarged SEM photographs of Fig. 1e\u2013f, the nano-scale holes between nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B are almost of the same size, with a diameter of 60\u2013100nm. However, due to the effect of SDR, micron-scale patterns are quite different between nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B. Therefore, it suggests that nano-scale holes are due to Ag-induced chemical etching, and micron-scale patterns can be traced back to the original surface structure before Ag-induced chemical etching. Fig. 2 shows the reflectance spectra of bare silicon, silicon sample after SDR, nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B before solar cell manufacturing process, after diffusion process and after PECVD process, respectively. Before solar cell manufacturing process, the natural high reflectance of bare silicon can be easily observed, and it goes a little higher after the SDR process (Fig. 2a). After the Ag-induced chemical etching, the reflectance of nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B can be suppressed to <5%. Compared with silicon sample after SDR, both nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B retain the advantage of very low surface reflectance after diffusion process (Fig. 2b). As another important process to suppress surface reflectance, PECVD was rarely reported in combination with Ag-induced etching. Fig. 2c shows both nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B still retain very low surface reflectance after PECVD process. Since no significant change in the surface reflectance of nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B is found before/after PECVD process, it is clear that nano-surface structure has huge impact on the decrease of the reflectance for nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B samples during the c-Si solar cell manufacturing process. Besides, nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B samples have lower reflectance in the wavelength ranging from 300nm to 600nm, but have higher reflectance from 600nm to 850nm than SDR one. This can be explained by the principle of optical quarter wavelength [25], which can be written as (1) n r i \u22c5 d = \u03bb / 4 As in Eq. (1), the product of refractive index ( n r i ) and SiN x thickness ( d ) is equal to a quarter of the wavelength ( \u03bb ), then the light of this wavelength falling vertically is completely extinguished. It can be easily seen that the lowest reflectance for nb\u2013Si is selected at 400\u2013450nm while that for SDR is selected at 700\u2013750nm. So the thickness of SiN x ARC on nb\u2013Si is not thick enough compared with SDR according to Eq. (1). This is because, under the same manufacturing process, the nb\u2013Si has a rougher surface with nano-scale patterns on micron-scale etching structure than SDR, thus making it difficult for SiN x to be deposited on the nb\u2013Si surface. According to ASTM G173-03 tables, the spectral irradiance in the range of 450\u2013600nm is the strongest among the AM-1.5G spectral irradiance. This suggests that the thickness of SiN x ARC on nb\u2013Si should be further adjusted by optimizing PECVD process condition (e.g. more deposition time) to suit this spectrum. Thus, a better light trapping effect for nb\u2013Si could be achieved by combining Ag-induced chemical etching and corresponding optimized PECVD process. The second major function of PECVD is to passivate the surface and bulk of c-Si. After forming emitter and then removing PSG, the minority carrier lifetimes of the samples, of which both sides have been passivated by SiN x , were measured by \u03bc\u2013PCD method. The effective lifetimes for silicon after SDR, nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B are 8.67\u03bcs, 5.26\u03bcs and 6.52\u03bcs, respectively. The reduced measured lifetimes of nb\u2013Si could be caused by the micron-/nano-structures, which were not well passivated by the above-mentioned relatively thin SiN x layer. Also, the reduced measured lifetimes could be attributed by some Ag contamination as discussed in 3.3. These results suggest that recombination for nb\u2013Si is a potential threat to gain high efficiency although more light is absorbed in the short wavelength region. 3.2 Photovoltaic properties of nb-Si solar cells Fig. 3 shows the photographs of the nb\u2013Si materials and the corresponding nb\u2013Si cells. The sizes were 50mm\u00d750mm. The dark black color indicates that the nb\u2013Si samples have a lower surface reflectance, thus absorbing more light (Fig. 3a\u2013b). During a standard solar cell manufacturing process, this surface structure made by Ag-induced chemical etching can survive the harsh environment (such as very high temperature of about 860\u00b0C and wet chemical etching by HF), and the finished nb\u2013Si solar cells retain the advantage of low reflectance with black surface color (Fig. 3c\u2013d). Although both nb\u2013Si\u2013A cell and nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell nearly show black color, the electronic performance of such cells is quite different. The solar cell performance parameters extracted from the illuminated I\u2013V curves are listed in Table 2. It is clear that the nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell has better electronic performance than the nb\u2013Si\u2013A cell, resulting in the efficiency enhancement of 34.5% for the average cells and 26.0% for the best cells. To further investigate the photovoltaic properties of nb\u2013Si solar cells, the best cell of each group was selected as the typical one. Fig. 4 shows the I\u2013V curves of these typical nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B cells under simulated sunlight at AM-1.5G spectrum (100mW/cm2) at 25\u00b0C. The inset shows the measured I\u2013V curves under dark environment. When illuminated, the nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell has better V oc, J sc and FF than the nb\u2013Si\u2013A cell, increased by 3.68%, 5.85% and 14.9%, respectively. Thus, it leads to an efficiency enhancement of 26.0%. Under the dark condition, the nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell indicates a better characteristic of PN junction, especially with lower value of series resistance (R s ). Moreover, without considering ohmic loss, the fitted reverse saturated current density (J 0 ) and ideality factor (n) have been decreased from 12.9pA/cm\u00b2 and 1.36 (nb\u2013Si\u2013A cell) to 7.13pA/cm\u00b2 and 1.26 (nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell), indicating that recombination has been suppressed by adding the SDR process. Fig. 5 shows the reflectance and IQE curves of the typical nb\u2013Si\u2013A and nb\u2013Si\u2013B cells. It is obvious that the nb\u2013Si cells have very low surface reflectance in the whole region of wavelength, keeping the advantage of low reflectance during the whole manufacturing process (from materials to devices). Besides, the nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell has lower reflectance than nb\u2013Si\u2013A in the wavelength region of 300\u20131050nm, indicating that the SDR process prior to Ag-induced etching can greatly suppress reflectance to an even high degree. Except for the relatively lower value in the wavelength region of 300\u2013520nm, the nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell has much higher IQE in the wavelength region of 520\u20131200nm, reflecting its lower recombination loss in the bulk. Perhaps, this reduced recombination of nb\u2013Si\u2013B could be attributed to the decreased degree of bulk contamination due to the relatively smooth surface structure (see Fig. 1d). In contrast, the nb\u2013Si\u2013A has very rough surface structure (see Fig. 1c), thus many impurities (such as Ag nanoparticles in the pores and the other undesirable particles) could easily \u201cstay\u201d between the top surface and the bottom bulk Si even after the cleaning process, and might cause the larger bulk recombination after the following high-temperature diffusion process. Overall, the J sc can be attributed to reflectance (R), IQE and solar photon flux ( J 0 A M 1.5 ) under AM 1.5, given as (2) J s c = q \u222b I Q E ( \u03bb ) ( 1 \u2212 R ( \u03bb ) ) J 0 A M 1.5 ( \u03bb ) d \u03bb As in Eq. (2), \u03bb is the absorbing wavelength region for c-Si and q is electron charge. So the larger J sc of the nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell was mainly owing to both lower reflectance in the wavelength region of 300\u20131050nm and higher IQE over the wavelength region between 520nm and 1200nm. Finally, it should be mentioned that SDR process is necessary and an indispensable path to improve photovoltaic properties for nb\u2013Si solar cell. As discussed above, the nb\u2013Si\u2013A cell and nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell were fabricated under the same condition except that the latter one has SDR process, making different optical and structural properties of nb\u2013Si materials. Fig. 1 shows that nb\u2013Si\u2013B sample has identical nano-scale holes but different micron-scale patterns, compared with the nb\u2013Si\u2013A. These micron-scale inverted triangle patterns formed by SDR brought about huge improved performance of the nb\u2013Si solar cells in Table 2 and Fig. 4. Considering nearly the same optical property between nb\u2013Si\u2013A cell and nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell, this improvement is largely resulted from lower recombination loss (e.g. higher V oc , IQE @ 520\u20131200nm, better J 0 and n) and ohmic loss (e.g. higher FF, lower R s ). 3.3 Modeling and further optimizations for nb-Si solar cells As mentioned above, nb\u2013Si solar cells have very low surface reflectance and strong light trapping effect. However, photovoltaic parameters of the nb\u2013Si solar cells in Table 2 are not very satisfactory due to its strong recombination loss in the short wavelength region. For example, Fig. 5 indicates that the short-wavelength spectral response for nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell is rather small while the IQE of nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell in the long wavelength is comparable to that of the traditionally textured mc-Si cell with efficiency of 15.8% in industry. This referenced mc-Si cell has low recombination loss that can be seen from smaller J 0 (1.41pA/cm2) and n (1.06). Thus, a solid explanation has to be issued to explain this puzzling recombination problem. First, it is important to know how these photovoltaic parameters have decreased. It is known to all that the solar cells based on PN junction will follow the following equations [26,27] under illumination (3) J s c = q G ( L e + W + L ) h , (4) J 0 = q n i 2 ( D e L e N A \u22c5 F P + D h L h N D \u22c5 F N ) , (5) F P = S r e a r cosh ( W P / L e ) + D / e L e sinh ( W P / L e ) S r e a r sinh ( W P / L e ) + D e / L e cosh ( W P / L e ) , (6) F N = S front cosh ( W N / L h ) + D / h L h sinh ( W N / L h ) S front sinh ( W N / L h ) + D h / L h cosh ( W N / L h ) , (7) V o c = n k T q ln ( J s c J 0 + 1 ) , where G is the average production rate of the non-equilibrium carrier in the diffusion length of the junction, n i is the intrinsic carrier concentration, W N , W and W P are the lengths of emitter, space charge region and base, D h and D e are the hole and electron diffusion coefficients, N A and N D are acceptor and donor level concentration, S front and S rear are the front and rear surface recombination velocity, and L h and L e are the diffusion lengths of holes and electrons, respectively. In Fig. 5, the short-wavelength spectral response for nb\u2013Si cells is rather small while the IQE of nb\u2013Si cells in the long wavelength region is comparable to that of the traditionally textured mc-Si cell with efficiency of 15.8% in industry. Thus, the small J sc of nb\u2013Si cells mainly lies in the poor emitter diffusion length L h according to Eq. (3). Also, the high S front would lead to degraded J sc according to more general expression [27]. And Eqs. (4\u20136) show that the poor L h or the high S front would also enlarge J o . As the J sc decreases and J o /n increases, the ultimate consequence is that the V oc would degenerate according to Eq. (7). Therefore, it is concluded that the decreasing photovoltaic parameters, such as V oc and J sc , have been caused by the relatively small emitter diffusion length L h or the large front surface recombination velocity S front . Next, the nb\u2013Si cell structure was further investigated by introducing the one-dimensional device program, PC1D [28]. Containing adequate and comprehensive physical mechanisms and calculations, PC1D simulation is much more accurate than the above Eqs. (3\u20137) with some simplifying assumptions. For the low short-wavelength IQE of nb\u2013Si\u2013B solar cell, it sounds physically plausible that very high front surface recombination velocity (process a in Fig. 6), resulted from the nanoporous surface with very high surface area, increases the high recombination loss in the short wavelength region. However, with nearly the same nanoporous structures, Yuan et al. [21] found that it was unable to model the IQE of their single-crystal FZ nb\u2013Si solar cells with just poor front-surface recombination velocity and reduced bulk lifetime; instead, a modeling method based on a low-lifetime \u201cdead layer\u201d of very high Auger recombination was offered. The method seems appropriate, but when it comes to our solar-grade mc-Si, which has inhomogeneous distribution of defects like dislocations, impurities and grain boundaries in material quality [29], the measured IQE curve cannot be fit properly by their method, let alone just considering higher front-surface recombination velocity. To solve this inconsistency, a newly introduced two-layer emitter model has been designed, which was well fitted with the measured IQE curve of the typical nb\u2013Si\u2013B solar cell, as shown in Fig. 5 (the green dash line). Detailed simulation parameters are listed in Table 3, containing explicit and quantitative parameters, such as front surface recombination velocity, front diffusion, background doping, bulk lifetime, rear diffusion and rear surface recombination velocity. Unlike the first emitter layer created by diffusion process, the so-called second emitter represents recombination on the front surface and in the bulk, which is unexplainable only by the first emitter. On one hand, the junction depth of the two-layer emitter model is really deep, which is also confirmed by using simplified calculating equation x j = Z D t [25]. Thus, most of the light in the short wavelength region cannot reach such deep PN junction (\u223c3.0\u03bcm), especially considering that the rough surface structure would shorten the penetration depth of light to a higher degree. On the other hand, the low emitter diffusion length L h (i.e. low minority carrier lifetime), largely resulted from high doping density of the two-layer emitter model, can cause poor blue response of nb\u2013Si\u2013B cell. Thus, the low short-wavelength IQE, V oc , and J sc can be well explained by the two emitters. Then, it is important to analyze why this unusual emitter has occurred. Although some possible reasons, such as enlarged surface areas of the rough surface or improperly passivated layer by PECVD, may be partly attributed to this unusual emitter, the most possible explanation is that the residual metal particles, such as Ag in our experiment, are very difficult to be removed completely. For example, Nishioka et al. [17] reported that no residual metal particles existed after removing Au nanoparticles, by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. However, Yuan et al. [21] have detected mid-1018 cm\u22123 of residual Au in the nanoporous layer by more precise secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis, which resulted in lowering the IQE curve in the short wavelength region. Our measured IQE curve coincides with this result, suggesting that Ag nanoparticles may not be removed so easily only by concentrated HNO3 solution, possibly owing to the rough and complex surface. Once the residual Ag contaminations could not be wiped out, it was likely that the recombination centers were generated from segregated and dissolved transition metal atoms [27]. Thus, the impurity level (process b in Fig. 6) was created during a standard c-Si solar cell manufacturing process, represented by a second emitter layer in our simulation model. Finally, the two-layer emitter model suggests that a novel method of removing residual Ag nanoparticles completely has to be invented to eliminate the effect of the simulated second emitter. Then, the simulated IQE curve of the two-layer emitter model will rise to a high IQE curve of the standard one-layer emitter model, shown as the dark cyan line that is very close to the magenta line in Fig. 5. Therefore, by Ag-induced chemical etching and removing residual Ag nanoparticles completely, the low surface reflectance/recombination loss could be realized and the conversion efficiency of the nb\u2013Si solar cells could be increased. 4 Conclusions By simple Ag-induced chemical etching, nb\u2013Si structures with/without SDR on solar-grade mc-Si substrates have been formed, which have the potential to be applied for manufacturing silicon solar cells in industry. The nb\u2013Si with unique morphologies of nano-scale holes and the low reflectance (<5%) were obtained. The photovoltaic properties of nb\u2013Si solar cells show that SDR prior to Ag-induced chemical etching is an effective way to reduce recombination loss and ohmic loss, resulting in significant efficiency enhancement of 26.0%. Although very low surface reflectance could be realized, the recombination loss still plays an important role in the depression of conversion efficiency. Thus, a two-layer emitter model has been introduced to fit the measured IQE curve of the nb\u2013Si solar cells, explaining the degraded spectral response. The modeling guideline could be provided to enhance spectral response for nb\u2013Si solar cells while retaining the low surface reflectance, thus the final conversion efficiency could be increased to satisfy the standard of high-efficiency mc-Si cells in industry.
