These systems require high investments which are returned through the heat sales. Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease, prolonging the investment return period. The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c outdoor temperature function for heat demand forecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665 buildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district renovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were compared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors. The results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications (the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation scenarios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered). The value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and renovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the coupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and improve the accuracy of heat demand estimations. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Renewables, 2 Place Jean Millier, 92078 Paris La D\u00c3\u00a9fense Cedex, France Abstract Thickness reduction of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell is one of the most efficient ways to reduce the cost of manufacturing process as well as Energy pack-back time (EPBT) and thus ecological footprint. However, thin solar cell goes with a lack of infra-red absorption of the solar spectra. To circumvent this effect, advanced light-trapping schemes involving nanostructured surfaces or black Silicon (b-Si) and/or pyramid textured surfaces are good candidates for light-trapping enhancement in thin bifacial n-PERT solar cell (80-180 \u00c2\u00b5m). In order to identify an optical optimum for thickness reduction, several combinations of different morphologies (Flat, Pyramid, b-Si and Saw damage removal - SDR) were modelled in front and/or rear side. Unfortunately, sizes of nanostructures are in the same range as wavelength of absorbed light, therefore geometrical optics is no more available which makes nanostructure not easy to model with conventional electro-optical simulation software. In this study, we integrate absorptance and reflectance measurements of b-Si into c-Si solar cell modelling process and thus demonstrate a +1%abs efficiency with one side nanotexturing and without antireflection coating layer compared to standard bifacial n-PERT solar cells. Moreover, mixing rear pyramid and front nanotexturing does not enhance significantly Jsc to be considered from a process integration perspective in simulated thickness range (80-180 \u00c2\u00b5m). Nevertheless, such a combination reaches higher light trapping and thus a better resilience to thickness reduction. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction This work aims at finding an optical optimum among five surface morphologies combined in front and rear side of simulated thin c-Si solar cell (80-180 \u00c2\u00b5m). The studied morphologies are the following: flat, pyramid, Saw Damage Removal (SDR) and two types of nanotextured surfaces or black-Silicon (b-Si) with different average lateral size (b-Si 1: around 63 nm and b-Si 2: around 500 nm). For such nanostructures, a standard ray tracing based on geometrical optics is not appropriate and diverges from experimental results as non-geometrical phenomena appear for wavelength close to nanostructure size. To circumvent this model limitation, our approach combines absorptance and reflectance measurements of b-Si surfaces with solar cell simulation done by Quokka2 [3]. In this work, we focus on bifacial n-type Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally diffuse (n-PERT) solar cell for thickness reduction. Firstly, due to n-type material quality such as high minority carrier lifetime, low bulk degradation and no light induced degradation compared to p-type material. Secondly, as thickness decreases, the cell ratio surface on volume increases and thus surface recombination becomes predominant. One way to limit this recombination is to repel minority carriers from rear and front surfaces as PERT structure offers with two fully doped surfaces.

Investigated structures Several types of structures are investigated in this study. Table 1 summarizes the details of the simulated and experimentally investigated structures. The Flat/Flat sample is considered optically flat on both sides, while the Pyramids/Pyramids sample is simulated by randomly distributed pyramids formed by (111) faces, and a lateral size of 5 \u00c2\u00b5m. These samples are covered on n+ back surface region side by 70 nm of SiNx and on p+ emitter side by a stack of 6 nm Al2O3 and 70 nm SiNx, which will both passivate the surface and act as an antireflection layer (ARC). The black silicon (b-Si) surfaces have been obtained by capacitively coupled plasma reactive ion etching of silicon samples using a mixture of SF6 and O2. The typical lateral size of the nanostructures is observed to increase with etching time, modifying its optical behavior [5].

Investigated structures Several types of structures are investigated in this study. Table 1 summarizes the details of the simulated and experimentally investigated structures. The Flat/Flat sample is considered optically flat on both sides, while the Pyramids/Pyramids sample is simulated by randomly distributed pyramids formed by (111) faces, and a lateral size of 5 \u00c2\u00b5m. These samples are covered on n+ back surface region side by 70 nm of SiNx and on p+ emitter side by a stack of 6 nm Al2O3 and 70 nm SiNx, which will both passivate the surface and act as an antireflection layer (ARC). The black silicon (b-Si) surfaces have been obtained by capacitively coupled plasma reactive ion etching of silicon samples using a mixture of SF6 and O2. The typical lateral size of the nanostructures is observed to increase with etching time, modifying its optical behavior [5]. The b-Si 1 texture (respectively b-Si 2) has been obtained after 10 min (respectively 45 min) of etching, leading to an average lateral size of the nanostructures of 63 \u00c2\u00b13 nm (respectively 0.50 \u00c2\u00b1 0.02 \u00c2\u00b5m) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c estimated thanks to SEM top-view image analysis [5], see also the SEM tilted view images on Fig.3(a-b).

Experimental determination of optical properties for black silicon Pyramid textured c-Si can effectively be modelled by a relatively simple ray tracing approach [1] based on geometrical optics, due to their simple morphology and typical lateral size of several microns, i.e. much larger than the wavelength of interest (roughly comprised between 280 and 1200 nm for silicon solar cells). However, this simple model fails to describe the optical properties of black silicon: indeed, the lateral size of such surfaces lies in the same range as the wavelength of incoming light. Other models (based on electromagnetic theory), such as the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) [6], or the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method [7-8] have been used to effectively simulate the optical behavior of black silicon structures. Yet, these methods require high computational resources and their results are usually only concordant with experiments in a limited range of wavelengths, especially due to simplifications on the modelled structures (e.g. periodicity, ideal geometrical shapes [9]). In order to compare the optical properties of black silicon structures with pyramidal texturing, we propose a much simpler approach where the optical properties of black silicon surfaces are evaluated experimentally (measurement of Rtot, Ttot and Atot by spectrophotometry with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9501) and used as inputs for a solar cell simulation using Quokka2 software [4]. With Quokka2, the optical properties of simulated structures are defined by two parameters: the transmittance TSi of light into the silicon bulk, and the path length enhancement factor Z (both being wavelength-dependent). Fig.4(a) shows a schematic of a c-Si sample with thickness w, covered symmetrically with a thin layer of dielectric. The following relations apply between the specified optical parameters: 1 Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or softwares are identified in this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by the authors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organizations, nor is it intended to imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose. 254 Rafa\u00c3\u00abl Peyronnet et al. / Energy Procedia 124 (2017) 250\u00e2\u20ac\u201c259 Rafa\u00c3\u00abl Peyronnet et al. / Energy Procedia 00 (2017) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 )()(1)( tottottot \u00ef\ufffd\u00ac\u00ef\ufffd\u00ac\u00ef\ufffd\u00ac TRA \u00ef\u20ac\u00ad\u00ef\u20ac\u00ad\u00ef\u20ac\u00bd )()()()( rearfrontSitot \u00ef\ufffd\u00ac\u00ef\ufffd\u00ac\u00ef\ufffd\u00ac\u00ef\ufffd\u00ac AAAA \u00ef\u20ac\u00ab\u00ef\u20ac\u00ab\u00ef\u20ac\u00bd where Atot, Rtot and Ttot are respectively the total absorptance, total reflectance and total transmittance, ASi Afront and Arear are respectively the fractions of incoming light absorbed in the c-Si bulk, the front and the rear coating layers. Notice that the only parameters available directly by spectrophotometric measurements are Rtot, Ttot and Atot. Some assumptions are thus needed in order to assess the parameters of interest for the simulation with Quokka2. Fig.4: (a) Schematic of the samples (not to scale) with relevant structural and optical (wavelength-dependent) parameters. (b) Solar spectral irradiance according to AM1.5g standard (ASTM2012) and absorption length of crystalline silicon [10]. We first assume that the absorption in the dielectric layers is null (which is valid in the case of ALD-Al2O3 having a bandgap higher than 6 eV), and that the free carrier absorption can be neglected (the samples used for the optical analysis are weakly doped, <1x1016 cm-3). Moreover, Rtot is the sum of the front reflectance Rfront (defined here as the fraction of light which does not enter the c-Si) and the escape reflectance Resc (defined as light escaping the c-Si \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for instance after reflection at the rear of the c-Si substrate). The contribution of Resc in Rtot is negligible for wavelength below 950 nm where the absorption length of silicon [10] is much shorter than the substrate thickness w (see Table 1, w > 150 \u00c2\u00b5m for the samples studied here). Thus, in the range [250, 950 nm], TSi can be approximated by 1-Rtot. In order to obtain the values of TSi for wavelengths in the range ]950, 1300 nm], a simple extrapolation based on a linear fitting of Rtot = r1\u00ef\ufffd\u00ac+r0 in the range [900, 950 nm] is performed. This simple extrapolation is supported for all the samples, first by the very small change in the refractive indices of c-Si, ALD- Al2O3 and PECVD-SiNx in the range [950, 1300 nm], and furthermore for nanotextured samples, by the pseudo- random distribution of the nanostructures on the surface.

Most importantly, while Z obviously depends on the c-Si substrate thickness, it is not the case for Z\u00e2\u02c6\u017e, Z0 and Zp: thus, once these three parameters are evaluated for a given substrate, Z can be predicted for any other substrate having a similar texture but a different thickness [3] and [11]. Fig.5(a) and (b) shows the results of the proposed analysis for sample b-Si 1/SDR. On Fig.5(a), the approximated front reflectance is computed according to Equation (1), together with the estimated upper and lower uncertainties with conservative hypotheses: below 950 nm the uncertainty is considered to be around 10 % relative, from 950 to 1300 nm the uncertainty is estimated to be linearly increasing from 10 to 50 %. On Fig.5(b), the result of the fitting of the absorptance measurement with the model of Equations (2) and (3) is shown. The difference between the modelled and measured absorptance lies below 1.2 % absolute in the whole spectral range. On this particular sample, the path length enhancement factor, shown on the same graph, tends to Z\u00e2\u02c6\u017e = 1.1 when the absorption coefficient increases (i.e. towards shorter wavelengths). On the other hand when the absorption coefficient decreases (i.e. towards longer wavelengths), Z tends to the asymptotic value Z0 = 3.5. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Optical properties of the studied structures Fig.5(c) and (d) shows the spectral transmittance to the c-Si and the wavelength dependent path length enhancement factor for the structures herein studied, either experimentally determined or simulated. From the transmittance spectra, the following results can be highlighted. First, and as expected, the Flat/Flat and Pyramids/Pyramids samples show a poor transmittance in the UV regions (below 400 nm approximately) because the SiNx ARC layers are optimized for a wavelength around 600 nm, and due to parasitic absorption in the SiNx. However, over the entire spectral range, the Pyramids/Pyramids sample shows a much better transmittance compared to the Flat/Flat sample thanks to its topography which reduces the reflection before being trapped due to multiple reflection between pyramids. On the other hand, all the samples including a nanotextured front surface have a high transmittance to silicon in this wavelength range. Finally, though the nanotexturing was performed simultaneously on samples b-Si 2/SDR and b-Si 2/Pyramids, there is a significant difference of transmittance between the two samples, which is attributed to a different initial roughness that modifies the optical properties of the resulting surface. Regarding the path length enhancement factor, Z, shown on Fig.5(d), the Flat/Flat simulated structure is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c performing very poorly over the entire near-IR region: the double side SiNx layer acts only as an ARC on both sides of the sample, resulting in a very poor light-trapping. The b-Si 1/SDR sample performs only slightly better for wavelengths above 1050 nm. This is attributed to a small level of scattering induced both by the front side b-Si and the back side SDR surface which exhibits lateral micrometric features. Notice that the mean lateral size of the nanostructures on the b-Si 1 surface (estimated in the order of 63 \u00c2\u00b1 3 nm) is too small to induce strong scattering. On the contrary, the other three studied structures (either simulated or experimentally obtained) perform much better for light-trapping. This is attributed to the fact that on each of these samples, a strong level of scattering is induced by the structuring of one or both sides of the sides. In particular, the nanostructures on the b-Si 2/SDR sample have an estimated mean lateral size of 0.5 \u00c2\u00b5m, which appears sufficient to induce a strong light-trapping compared to the b-Si 1/SDR sample where the nanostructures are an order of magnitude smaller.

On Fig.5(a), the approximated front reflectance is computed according to Equation (1), together with the estimated upper and lower uncertainties with conservative hypotheses: below 950 nm the uncertainty is considered to be around 10 % relative, from 950 to 1300 nm the uncertainty is estimated to be linearly increasing from 10 to 50 %. On Fig.5(b), the result of the fitting of the absorptance measurement with the model of Equations (2) and (3) is shown. The difference between the modelled and measured absorptance lies below 1.2 % absolute in the whole spectral range. On this particular sample, the path length enhancement factor, shown on the same graph, tends to Z\u00e2\u02c6\u017e = 1.1 when the absorption coefficient increases (i.e. towards shorter wavelengths). On the other hand when the absorption coefficient decreases (i.e. towards longer wavelengths), Z tends to the asymptotic value Z0 = 3.5. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Optical properties of the studied structures Fig.5(c) and (d) shows the spectral transmittance to the c-Si and the wavelength dependent path length enhancement factor for the structures herein studied, either experimentally determined or simulated. From the transmittance spectra, the following results can be highlighted. First, and as expected, the Flat/Flat and Pyramids/Pyramids samples show a poor transmittance in the UV regions (below 400 nm approximately) because the SiNx ARC layers are optimized for a wavelength around 600 nm, and due to parasitic absorption in the SiNx. However, over the entire spectral range, the Pyramids/Pyramids sample shows a much better transmittance compared to the Flat/Flat sample thanks to its topography which reduces the reflection before being trapped due to multiple reflection between pyramids. On the other hand, all the samples including a nanotextured front surface have a high transmittance to silicon in this wavelength range. Finally, though the nanotexturing was performed simultaneously on samples b-Si 2/SDR and b-Si 2/Pyramids, there is a significant difference of transmittance between the two samples, which is attributed to a different initial roughness that modifies the optical properties of the resulting surface. Regarding the path length enhancement factor, Z, shown on Fig.5(d), the Flat/Flat simulated structure is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c performing very poorly over the entire near-IR region: the double side SiNx layer acts only as an ARC on both sides of the sample, resulting in a very poor light-trapping. The b-Si 1/SDR sample performs only slightly better for wavelengths above 1050 nm. This is attributed to a small level of scattering induced both by the front side b-Si and the back side SDR surface which exhibits lateral micrometric features. Notice that the mean lateral size of the nanostructures on the b-Si 1 surface (estimated in the order of 63 \u00c2\u00b1 3 nm) is too small to induce strong scattering. On the contrary, the other three studied structures (either simulated or experimentally obtained) perform much better for light-trapping. This is attributed to the fact that on each of these samples, a strong level of scattering is induced by the structuring of one or both sides of the sides. In particular, the nanostructures on the b-Si 2/SDR sample have an estimated mean lateral size of 0.5 \u00c2\u00b5m, which appears sufficient to induce a strong light-trapping compared to the b-Si 1/SDR sample where the nanostructures are an order of magnitude smaller. 256 Rafa\u00c3\u00abl Peyronnet et al. / Energy Procedia 124 (2017) 250\u00e2\u20ac\u201c259 Rafa\u00c3\u00abl Peyronnet et al. / Energy Procedia 00 (2017) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 Fig.5: (a) Example of measured total reflectance and proposed approximation of the front reflectance (with upper and lower uncertainties limits) for the b-Si 1/SDR sample. (b) Example of measured absorptance and obtained fit and path length enhancement factor according to the model proposed by McIntosh and Baker-Finch [1] for the b-Si 1/SDR sample. (c) Transmittance TSi (i.e. light entering the silicon substrate) and (d) path length enhancement factor Z for the five studied structures (substrate thickness of 180 \u00c2\u00b5m). On all graphs, dashed lines (respectively solid lines) correspond to experimentally derived data (resp. ray tracing simulated data). 3.2. Simulation results First, we notice a gain in the simulated EQE on the UV spectra part for b-Si without anti-reflective coating compared to other types of surface thanks to higher characteristic angle. This angle is defined between b-Si facets and substrate surface plane. It is in the range of 70-80\u00c2\u00b0 for nanostructure compare to 54.74\u00c2\u00b0 for pyramids (Theoretical angle between {100} and {111} Silicon planes). Such an improvement is related to the transmission gain discussed in the previous part. It demonstrates a potential solar cell performance enhancement of +1%abs by replacing standard pyramid texturing by black Silicon or nanostructured texturing. This result does not take into account encapsulant absorption in the final panel structure. When the nanostructure size is smaller than the scaled wavelength (\u00ef\ufffd\u0152\u00ef\u20ac \u00ef\u20ac\u00bc \u00ce\u00bb/\u00ef\u20ac nSi\u00ef\u20ac\u00a9, nanostructures can be considered equivalent to a layer with a refractive index gradient ([5] effective medium approach), and therefor induce almost no scattering. This is why b-Si 1 with 63 nm average lateral nanostructure size (\u00ef\ufffd\u0152\u00ef\u20ac\u00a9 shows smaller IQE than b-Si 2 with \u00ef\ufffd\u0152\u00ef\u20ac \u00ef\u20ac\u00bd\u00ef\u20ac 500 nm on Fig.6. Both IQE/EQE graph are shown only until 1120 nm because free carrier absorption is neglected for front p+ emitter and n+ back surface region into the light-trapping model [3]. Among every combination of front and rear surface morphologies simulated in this work, two of them stand out from the rest. The highest short-circuit current densities and efficiencies were attained with b-Si 2 (large structures) on front side and pyramid on the rear (see red curve on Fig.6 and Fig.7). However, similar results were also obtained with b-Si 2 on front and SDR surface on the rear (see blue curve on Fig.6 and Fig.7). Differences between those two Rafa\u00c3\u00abl Peyronnet et al. / Energy Procedia 00 (2017) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 results are very narrow (\u00c2\u00b1 0.2%abs on efficiency and \u00c2\u00b1 0.5 mA/cm\u00c2\u00b2 on Jsc). Thereby, combining rear side pyramids with front side b-Si does not significantly enhance solar cell Jsc but increases fabrication process complexity. This is the reason why the b-Si 2 front and SDR rear sample holds our attention for 180 \u00c2\u00b5m n-PERT bifacial cells. Finally, resilience of cell performances over cell thickness reduction was calculated (see Fig.7(e)) through normalized efficiency at cell thickness of 180 \u00c2\u00b5m. As expected, Jsc losses due to thickness reduction strongly depend on light-trapping properties (see Fig.5(d)). Thus, considering thickness below the range of interest of this work (80- 180 \u00c2\u00b5m), the b-Si 2 front and pyramid rear combination should be significantly higher than the others.

Limitations of the study Using simple optical characterizations (at an early stage of the development of the nanotexturing) and solar cell simulation with Quokka2, this study has shown that nanotexturing would be susceptible to compete with typical chemical texturing on the way towards thinner n-PERT solar cell. Indeed, nanotexturing is shown compatible with high efficiencies, as the photogenerated current gain due to light-trapping becomes preponderant when the absorber thickness is reduced [12]. However, in order to surpass conventional chemical texturing in terms of efficiency, the collection of photogenerated carriers from UV light has to be ensured. To this aim, several conditions have to be fulfilled and have not been taken into account in the present study. In particular, depending on the emitter doping level and formation [13], the losses in external quantum efficiency in the UV region are underestimated, and a careful study of the recombination level in the emitter will have to be conducted. A better prediction of the blue response of nanotextured solar cells would require additional EQE measurements. Moreover, a large part of the UV light might be lost due to the encapsulant material absorption in the module [14]. In the near-IR region where silicon becomes semi-transparent, the uncertainty on the extrapolation of the transmittance (Equation 1) showed to have little influence on the simulated solar cell performances. Regarding the light path enhancement factor, the very good agreement (adjusted coefficient of determination superior to 0.999) between the measured absorptance and the model shows the relevance of the model from McIntosh and Baker-Finch (Equation 2 and 3) even in the case of nanostructured surfaces. This stems in particular from the absence of photonic effects due to the pseudo-random distribution of the nanostructures. Furthermore, simulations were performed only under a front illumination without albedo reflection as Quokka2 does not include both side illuminations on same time. Thus no bifaciality gain was studied in this work. Finally, results of this work should be considered as an optical perspective. Indeed issues of surface passivation have not been taken into account into this study, as the surface recombination velocity (SRV) has been set to an identical value (100 cm/s) for all tested structures. In experimental devices, using similar passivation schemes with different surface morphologies would produce different values of SRV, especially due to higher surface area of nanostructured silicon surfaces [15]. However, the herein implemented SRV values can be considered conservative as much lower values have been reported for ALD-Al2O3 passivated black silicon surfaces [16]. 4. Conclusion Several solar cell simulations with different combinations of front and rear texturing including black silicon were performed. Results point a potential +1%abs efficiency gain for one side front nanotexturing cell without antireflection coating layer compared to standard antireflection coatings on both sides pyramid texturing for bifacial n-PERT solar cells. Caution should be taken to average lateral size of nanostructures, because below the scaled wavelength limit (\u00ce\u00bb/nSi) such a surface scatters no more light and thus implies light-trapping losses. Furthermore, from a process integration perspective, combining rear pyramid texturing with front nanotexturing on a solar cell does not enhance significantly Jsc to be considered at 180 \u00c2\u00b5m thickness compared to a polish etched rear with front nanotexturing. However, such a combination affords higher light trapping and thus higher resilience of optical performances over a solar cell thickness reduction.

Caution should be taken to average lateral size of nanostructures, because below the scaled wavelength limit (\u00ce\u00bb/nSi) such a surface scatters no more light and thus implies light-trapping losses. Furthermore, from a process integration perspective, combining rear pyramid texturing with front nanotexturing on a solar cell does not enhance significantly Jsc to be considered at 180 \u00c2\u00b5m thickness compared to a polish etched rear with front nanotexturing. However, such a combination affords higher light trapping and thus higher resilience of optical performances over a solar cell thickness reduction.

Renewables 2 Place Jean Millier Paris La D\u00e9fense Cedex 92078 France Thickness reduction of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell is one of the most efficient ways to reduce the cost of manufacturing process as well as Energy pack-back time (EPBT) and thus ecological footprint. However, thin solar cell goes with a lack of infra-red absorption of the solar spectra. To circumvent this effect, advanced light-trapping schemes involving nanostructured surfaces or black Silicon (b-Si) and/or pyramid textured surfaces are good candidates for light-trapping enhancement in thin bifacial n-PERT solar cell (80-180 \u00b5m). In order to identify an optical optimum for thickness reduction, several combinations of different morphologies (Flat, Pyramid, b-Si and Saw damage removal - SDR) were modelled in front and/or rear side. Unfortunately, sizes of nanostructures are in the same range as wavelength of absorbed light, therefore geometrical optics is no more available which makes nanostructure not easy to model with conventional electro-optical simulation software. In this study, we integrate absorptance and reflectance measurements of b-Si into c-Si solar cell modelling process and thus demonstrate a +1%abs efficiency with one side nanotexturing and without antireflection coating layer compared to standard bifacial n-PERT solar cells. Moreover, mixing rear pyramid and front nanotexturing does not enhance significantly Jsc to be considered from a process integration perspective in simulated thickness range (80-180 \u00b5m). Nevertheless, such a combination reaches higher light trapping and thus a better resilience to thickness reduction.
