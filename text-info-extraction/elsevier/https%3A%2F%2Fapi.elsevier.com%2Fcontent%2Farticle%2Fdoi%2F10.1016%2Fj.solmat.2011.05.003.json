We report a relatively simple process for fast nano-texturing of p-type (100) silicon surface using silver catalyzed wet chemical etching in aqueous hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution at room temperature. In this approach, a fine textured black surface was achieved in about 15\u201330s duration with reflectivity less than 4% in 400\u20131000nm range. The reflectivity versus texturization time has been investigated and co-related with morphological characteristics of the nano-textured-silicon (nT-Si) surfaces. The nano-texturization process is also applicable in multi-crystalline silicon. Further, n+\u2013p\u2013p+ structured solar cells have been fabricated on such nT-Si substrates following the standard fabrication protocol. Significant improvement in short circuit current density (>20%) and efficiency (\u223c1.25% absolute) has been achieved compared with planar control cell without deterioration of other performance parameters (such as open circuit voltage and fill factor). Light beam induced current measurements have also been carried out to show the spatial distribution of the light trapping and current in the planar and the nT-Si solar cells.

Keywords Silicon solar cells Wet etching Nano-texturing Antireflection coating LBIC 1 Introduction Polished silicon surface has a high natural reflectivity (>35%) with a strong spectral dependence and therefore, minimization of reflection losses is extremely important for efficient silicon solar cells. Usually, transparent quarter wavelength layers of silicon oxide (SiO x ), silicon nitride (Si x N y ) or titanium oxide (TiO x ) with intermediate or gradient refractive indices are used as antireflection coating (ARC) [1, pp. 345,2]. These coatings have resonant structures and work effectively only in a limited spectral range. A variety of other approaches have also been developed to minimize the reflection losses through modifying surface topography [3,4] wherein the losses are reduced by surface texturing using anisotropic etching generally done in aqueous alkaline solution. However, this process is limited to single crystalline silicon (c-Si) only [1,4] and not very effective in multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) due to different orientations of grains. Porous silicon, formed by electrochemical etching, is another such approach to reduce reflection loss in the range of 5\u20138% [5]. Another promising approach to minimize reflectivity utilizes a nano-textured (nT) surface, comprising features on the nanometer scale. Such surfaces are called sub-wavelength structures (SWSs) [6]. The SWSs are the surface relief structures with dimensions smaller than the wavelength of incident light. Hadobas et al. [7] have shown that surfaces based on SWSs can reduce surface reflection to minimum at 600nm for SWSs layer depth (d) to wavelength (\u03bb) ratio 0.4 and effectively to zero for the higher ratio (\u2aa20.4) [7]. Moth-eye structures are typical example of SWS surfaces and a number of attempts have been made to achieve the low reflecting silicon surface [8,9] using this approach. To date, different dry etching methods based on reactive ion etching (RIE) [10], employing selective etching through alumina template, silicon dioxide (SiO2) micro-masks, catalytic action of various metals and nano-imprint lithography have been developed for the fabrication of SWS surfaces to produce \u2018black silicon\u2019[6\u201314]. However, the process complexity, low throughput and cost are big concerns for these methods and therefore, limit their applications such as for silicon solar cells in particular. Recently, Koynov et al. [15] reported gold (Au) catalyzed process for nano-texturing of silicon surface suppressing reflection loss below 5% wherein Au thin film (1\u20132nm) was pre-deposited on polished silicon by the thermal evaporation technique. However, in our view Au-assisted process is deleterious to the solar cell device as it is a known lifetime killing metal impurity [16] and traces of which may kill the solar cell performance completely. Thus, development of a simple process to prepare low reflecting surface and integration of such surface into silicon solar cell fabrication needs to be explored. In our earlier study, we have found that silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays prepared via wet chemical etching of silicon in aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution can reduce reflection as low as \u223c2% [17]. However, SiNW arrays solar cells had technical problems associated with the inherent SiNW arrays structural characteristics such as non-compact metal contact formation, enhanced surface area, etc. besides processing related issues [18]. Such problems could be minimized in the nano-textured-silicon (nT-Si) surfaces. Therefore, motivation for the present investigation was to develop a relatively simple process for the preparation of nT-Si surface with excellent antireflection property, which should be compatible with silicon solar cells fabrication protocol. In this paper, we report a relatively simple and fast process for nano-texturing of p-Si surface using Ag-catalyzed wet chemical etching in aqueous HF and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution at room temperature wherein wafer-scale black nT-Si surface can be obtained in a very short duration (about 15\u201330s) with reflectivity (R \u03bb ) below 4% in 400\u20131000nm range. The reflectivity versus texturization time has been investigated and co-related with morphological features of the nT-Si surfaces. Further, we have demonstrated that the nT-Si process can easily be integrated in conventional silicon solar cells fabrication protocol. Measurements such as current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V), quantum efficiency and light beam induced current (LBIC) have shown a significant improvement in nT-Si solar cell performance compared with planar cell made on polished silicon. 2 Experimental details 2.1 Sample preparation The nT-Si samples were prepared using (100) p-type (1.2\u00b10.05\u03a9cm, boron doped), Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers of 325\u00b110\u03bcm thickness. All the samples used in the present investigation have the same material specifications. In the very first step of the process, as-cut or lapped wafers were etched using HF and nitric acid (HNO3) solution or concentrated potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution to remove surface damages (\u223c15\u03bcm from each side) caused by saw wires, etc. This step is essential in solar cells fabrication. After damage removal the chemical polishing or alkaline texturization (in 2% KOH+20% iso-propyl alcohol solution at 80\u00b0C for 30min) was carried out. In the case of Ag-catalyzed nano-texturization, both chemically polished (CP) and commercially available chemically mechanically polished (CMP) wafers were used. It was noticed that nano-texturization of silicon wafers was not affected by the initial wafer surface morphology (CP or CMP silicon). The silicon wafers were sequentially cleaned with acetone, de-ionized (DI) water and boiled in piranha solution using sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and H2O2 in 3:1 (vol.) ratio for 60min. The wafers were then rinsed thoroughly with DI water followed by 5% HF solution dip to remove native oxide. The nano-texturization process included two steps, and schematic of these are shown in the steps (i\u2013iii) in Fig. 1. In step (i) a thin layer of Ag film (\u223c5nm) was deposited over the polished Si (CP or CMP) using the electro-less metal deposition (EMD) at room temperature in aqueous 4M HF solution containing 0.008M AgNO3 for 10s followed by DI water rinse. In this process no external electric current (or electrodes) is required. The EMD process, in an ionic metal containing HF solution, is based on micro-electrochemical redox reaction in which both cathodic and anodic reactions occur simultaneously at the metal/semiconductor interface. This resulted in a thin layer of Ag nano-islands uniformly distributed over the entire sample area. After deposition of the Ag nano-islands film, wafers were thoroughly rinsed in DI water and dried in nitrogen for the next processing step. In step (ii) Ag deposited silicon wafers were immersed in H2O2:HF:DI water::1:2:10 (vol.) solution at room temperature for different time durations (15\u2013120s) for Ag-catalyzed texturization. The polished Si surface turned uniformly black within 15\u201330s. The residual Ag nanoparticles from the nT-Si were removed completely by etching in ammonia (NH3) and H2O2 solution in 3:1 (vol.) ratio at room temperature. Finally, the nT samples (as shown in step iii) were rinsed with DI water, blown dry in nitrogen and subjected to further investigations. Morphology of the samples was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM; Model LEO 440 VP) and reflectivity measurements were carried out using spectrophotometer (Shimadzu; Model UV 3101PC with an integrating sphere) in 350\u20131200nm wavelength range. It is also important to mention that the present nano-texturization process is equally applicable to mc-Si wafers wherein lapped mc-Si wafers were subjected to nano-texturization after damage removal. 2.2 Solar cell fabrication Solar cells were fabricated on CMP, CP, alkaline (KOH) textured (aT-Si) and nano-textured-silicon (nT-Si were prepared using both as-cut and commercially available CMP wafers) of identical electrical/electronic properties (resistivity, orientation, thickness, etc.) in the same batch. For the co-relation of the reflectivity data with nT-Si solar cells performance, only the results of nT-Si cells fabricated on CMP (as starting wafers) are reported. This is because no significant difference was observed in the CP and CMP based nT-cell performances. The cells made on CMP wafers were used as control in our process because of their known reflectivity as well as for comparison of the cells performance having different surface morphologies (anisotropically textured and nT surfaces). In true sense a comparison with anisotropically textured (aT) cell would be interesting but the reflectivity of aT-surface depends on several parameters such as temperature, time and etching solution concentration used to create random pyramids [4]. The n+\u2013p\u2013p+ structure based solar cells were fabricated by conventional cell fabrication protocol [4], the schematic of which is given in Fig. 1 (steps iv\u2013vi). After RCA cleaning, the wafers having different morphologies were subjected to phosphorus diffusion using solid dopant disc source at 920\u00b0C followed by Al layer deposition on the rear surface by e-beam evaporation and alloying in inert ambient at 850\u00b0C using rapid thermal processing (RTP; Annealsys, Model: As-One 150) to form back surface field (BSF). The front metal contacts were made by Ti/Ag deposition through metal masks using e-beam evaporation followed by contact sintering in forming gas in the RTP. Finally, \u223c2.4\u00d72.4cm2 solar cells were diced from the wafer for the electrical characterization. It is to be mentioned that samples of nT-Si (two each of 30, 60 and 90s), two CMP, two CP wafers and two aT-Si wafers, i.e., a total 12 wafers were processed in one batch (and a number of such batches were processed to see the reproducibility of the results in terms of processing). The results were repeatable from batch to batch (within \u00b15%). It is to be noted that the data reported in the paper are the representative values of the cell parameter for a particular type of cell's surface morphology. Electrical characterization of the solar cells were carried out using an I\u2013V and spectral response system (Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Model: CEP-25HS-50 SR) under AM 1.5G spectral irradiance (100mW/cm2 at 25\u00b0C). The reflectance and LBIC mapping of solar cells were measured using a commercial mapping system (Semilab, Model: WT 2000 PV) with a diode laser of wavelength 855nm and spot size of 100\u03bcm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Nano-texturing Fig. 2 shows reflectivity (R \u03bb ) versus wavelength curves of the CMP, aT-Si, nT-Si surfaces (for varying texturing time) and nT surface prepared on chemically polished mc-Si wafer (with the best R \u03bb ). The reflection spectrum of the polished silicon (both CMP and CP) surface shows the typical high R \u03bb (\u223c34%) whereas average R \u03bb achieved in aT-Si is\u223c11.9% in the 400\u20131000nm wavelength range. In the case of nT-Si samples, the average R \u03bb is reduced to less than 4% for 15\u201330s nT-Si surfaces. The variation of average R \u03bb with texturing time (t etch) for nT-Si samples is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. This clearly shows that the average R \u03bb of nT-Si increases gradually with increasing texturing time. The origin of the low reflectivity produced by the nano-texturization can be understood from the morphology of the etched Si surface as shown in Fig. 3 wherein Fig. 3a, b and c shows the top surface morphology of the 30, 60 and 90s nT-Si, respectively. The corresponding cross-sectional view of the samples is also shown in the respective insets of Fig. 3. From Fig. 3a it can be seen that surface with nano-pores of diameter 40\u2013100nm and vertical depth of 300\u2013400nm is obtained in 30s nT-Si. Longer texture time produces relatively wider and deeper pores (see arrows in inset of Fig. 3c). The 60s (90s) nT-Si surface has pores of diameter \u223c100\u2013200nm (\u223c300\u2013600nm) and vertical depth \u223c500\u2013600nm (\u223c900\u20131000nm). Pores density is found to vary with texturing time and is estimated to be \u223c6\u00d7109, \u223c2\u00d7109 and \u223c5\u00d7108 per cm2 for 30, 60 and 90s nT-Si samples, respectively. The fractional area occupied by Si as a function of the depth across the textured layer gradually increases as can be seen from the respective cross-sectional images (insets of Fig. 3a\u2013c). This may cause a gradual increase in the fractional density of Si (and therefore the graded refractive index) along the depth of the pores (at the interface of nT and non-textured silicon). Such structures have close resemblance with SWSs [12,15]. As mentioned earlier R \u03bb reduces to minimum for the textured layer depth (d) to wavelength (\u03bb) ratio greater than 0.4 [7], therefore, a texture of only 300\u2013400nm in depth should be enough to suppress the reflection losses in the entire spectral range of interest for silicon solar cells [15]. We have realized the lowest R \u03bb in 15\u201330s textured surfaces in the spectral range 400\u20131000nm (minimum and maximum d/\u03bb ratio is equal to 0.4 and 1 considering d=400nm and \u03bb max =1000nm and \u03bb min=400nm). Branz et al. [19] have shown graded index \u201cblack silicon\u201d surface using Au-assisted etching of silicon and deduced a \u2018Scaling law\u2019 using the measured depth dependence on wavelength. In our case the value of reflectivity increases gradually with etching time, which is opposite to the observation made in Ref. [19]. This observation is puzzling and needs further investigations in terms of surface morphology and better understanding of etching mechanism. However, the deep and wider pores seen particularly in 90s textured silicon (inset of Fig. 3c) may disturb the gradual increase in fractional coverage of Si causing abrupt change of effective refractive index at the nT surface and silicon (non-textured silicon region) interface. Consequently, longer texturing duration will result in substantial change in refractive index at the interface and hence increased reflection. Therefore, 15\u201330s texturing of the silicon surface is good enough to minimize reflectivity below 4% (in the entire usable spectral range) for silicon solar cells. It is to be noted that the texturization of the polished silicon was also tried without thin Ag layer in the same solution (H2O2:HF:DI water::1:2:10) at room temperature where the texturization process was very slow and no significant change in the reflectivity could be observed. Therefore, nano-texturization of the silicon may be attributed to the catalytic action of the Ag nano-islands and, therefore, an analogy can be drawn from Ag assisted growth of SiNWs in aqueous HF and AgNO3 solution [20] where the continuous galvanic displacement of Si via formation of many local nano-electrochemical cells on the silicon surface takes place. In brief, the Ag nanoparticles act as cathode and silicon surface in contact with the Ag nanoparticles as anode. H2O2 act as oxidizing agent and injects hole in the Si valence band facilitated by Ag nanoparticles [21]. Silicon surface in contact with Ag is locally oxidized, which is subsequently etched away by HF. As mentioned earlier, the nano-texturization process was applied on mc-Si also and the best average R \u03bb <3% has been achieved (for 30s texturing) in 400\u20131000nm wavelength range as can be seen from Fig. 2. A representative SEM micrograph of the textured mc-wafers is also shown in Fig. 3d. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the Ag-catalyzed nano-texturization process in mc-Si wafers and its versatility for both c-Si and mc-Si. 3.2 I\u2013V measurements Fig. 4 shows illuminated I\u2013V characteristics of the control cell made on planar surface and nT-Si solar cells for different periods of texturing time. The solar cell parameters such as short circuit current density (J sc), open circuit voltage (V oc), fill factor (FF), efficiency (\u03b7), series (R s ) and shunt (R sh) resistances and emitter dark saturation current density (J oe) for all cells are summarized in Table 1. Among the three nT-Si based solar cells, as expected, the 30s nT-Si solar cell has shown the best performance. In this cell, the J sc is 28.9mA/cm2 and \u03b7 is 11.7% compared with 23.9mA/cm2 and 10.45%, respectively, on the control cell. It has V oc\u223c578mV and FF of \u223c0.71 and corresponding values in the control cell are 570mV and 0.76, respectively. The V oc and FF for all the three nT-Si solar cells (30, 60 and 90s) are almost comparable (within \u223c2% and\u223c6%, respectively) to the control cell. It indicates that good quality electrical contacts could be realized on nT-Si solar cells. The variations in FF of the four cells could be attributed to the different values of parasitic resistances such as shunt and series resistances (Table 1). For example, the lowest FF in the case of 30s nT-Si cell could be attributed to the high series and low shunt resistances. These variations could be due to the different surface morphology of the textured surfaces that needs fine tuning of process parameters for individual type of cells. In summary, nT-silicon provides significant improvement in J sc (>20%) and \u03b7 (\u223c1.25% absolute) compared to its planar counterpart primarily due to the enhanced light absorption in the former. The decrease in J sc for 60 and 90s nT-Si based cells may be attributed to the relatively higher R \u03bb values. The cells fabricated on aT-Si samples showed \u223c7\u201310% gain in the J sc as compared to that on CMP based planar cell which is significantly less than the value realized on nT-Si cells (>20%). V oc and FF of the aT-Si cells were practically the same as that of planar control cell. Also, the improvement in J sc in nT-mc-Si was between 15\u201320% compared to planar cells made on chemically polished mc-Si. The details of nT-mc-Si solar cells will be published elsewhere. 3.3 IQE and LBIC measurements Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the planar control cell and the best nT-Si based cell are compared in Fig. 5 along with the reflectivity of the cell surfaces (but R \u03bb measured before making metal contacts), which is practically the same (<5% in the 400\u20131000nm range) even after high temperature processing such as phosphorous diffusion, BSF alloying and harsh chemical process steps such as phosphor\u2013silicate glass removal. However, the IQE in the nT-Si based cell is reduced slightly in the short wavelength region, which could be attributed to following: (i) the quality of the emitter and as a consequence small contribution from \u03bb<500nm (as reflected in the IQE data in the short wavelength region), (ii) lack of surface passivation and (iii) optimization of process parameters of different type of surfaces individually (presently all the samples are processed in the single batch). In order to assess the role of surface recombination, the surface recombination velocity (S eff,) was calculated by measuring the effective minority carrier lifetime (\u03c4 eff,) on the CMP, aT-Si and the 30s nT-Si wafers (without giving any passivation treatment) using the microwave based photoconductance decay (\u03bc-PCD) method (Semilab; Model WT 2000). The measured average \u03c4 eff, values were 6.2, 5.3 and 3.6\u03bcs, respectively. It indicates that the \u03c4 eff, in nT-Si samples decrease by a factor of \u223c1.7 compared to the CMP Si wafer. The limiting S eff, was calculated using the following expression [22]: S eff , = W / 2 \u03c4 eff , where W is the wafer thickness. The calculated S eff, were 2620 (CMP), 3066 (aT-Si) and 4514cm/s (nT-Si). The increased S eff, in nT-Si samples may be attributed to the enlarged effective surface area (A eff) of nano-textured surface. The S eff, for aT-Si and nT-Si are \u223c1.2 and \u223c1.7 times that of CMP wafers. Therefore, the A eff for aT-Si and nT-Si surfaces may be estimated as \u223c1.2\u00d7 and \u223c1.7\u00d7 that of the planar surfaces and hence more contribution (per unit area) towards surface recombination losses is expected. It is to be noted that our estimation of area is almost correct because in aT-Si case, the area increase is \u223c1.2\u00d7 (w.r.t. planar surface) which is close to the 1.3\u00d7 calculated theoretically in the ideal case. The increase in A eff depends on the quality of the alkaline texturization and is always lower than 1.3\u00d7. Therefore, V oc and quantum efficiency in our case is affected but only marginally due to increased surface area. The performance of the nT-Si based solar cell was further confirmed by LBIC measurements. The spatial variation of the reflectance and current in the solar cells in control cell and the best nT-Si cell (30s nT-Si cell) are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. It is clear from the maps that reflectance is reduced to \u223c4\u20135% uniformly over the entire active area (excluding metal regions) of 30s nT-Si solar cell (see Fig. 6b) which re-confirm our claim of low reflectance on the finished nT-Si solar cells. Effect of reduced R \u03bb is also reflected in the spatial current distribution shown in Fig. 6c and d for the control and 30s nT-Si solar cells, respectively. A comparison of Fig. 6d and c clearly shows an overall current enhancement in the nT-Si cell (average current values 85.17 and 55.03\u03bcA for 30s nT-Si and control planar cell, respectively). This corroborates with the results shown in Fig. 4. Although, the solar cell performance in terms of efficiency is rather low but the purpose of the work is to give a \u201cproof of concept\u201d of application (as ARC) and compatibility of Ag-catalyzed nano-texturization process in conventional solar cell processing. The gaps in processing such as surface passivation and related aspects will be incorporated in our future reports. 4 Conclusion We have developed a simple and fast Ag-catalyzed chemical process for nano-texturization of silicon surface wherein reflectivity <4% can be achieved in the usable spectral range for silicon solar cells. Significant improvement (>20%) in the short circuit current density and efficiency (\u223c1.25% absolute) has been demonstrated in the nT-Si solar cells compared to the planar cell. The quantum efficiency analysis reveals relatively inferior response in short wavelength region for nT-Si based solar cell that may be due to the increased surface area of nano-textured surface compared with the planar surface. An effective passivation of the surface can further improve the efficiency of the nT-Si based solar cells. Silver catalyzed electro-less nano-texturing is a simple, fast and low cost process to realize an effective low reflective Si surface, which has potential for silicon solar cells, although there is a lot of scope to improve the process to exploit the full potential of nano-textured surface in silicon solar cells.
