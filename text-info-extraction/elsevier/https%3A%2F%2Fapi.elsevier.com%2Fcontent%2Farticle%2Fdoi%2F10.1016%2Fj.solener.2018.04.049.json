Graphical abstract A combination of Cu-MCCE method and a HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment process is used to decorate the surface morphology of Si textures, which is demonstrated to be helpful in reducing surface recombination and improving the cell performance. Mass production of diamond-wire-sawn (DWS) multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells reached a significant point of maturity through utilization of metal-catalyzed chemical etching (MCCE). However, the reported studies always focus on how to optimize the MCCE process but there are few studies concentrating on the post-treatment techniques to improve the cell efficiency. In this paper, we use a combination of Cu-MCCE method and a HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment process to decorate the surface of Si textures for the first time. The submicron polygonal chamfered cone structure produced by the post-processing treatment is demonstrated to be helpful in reducing surface recombination and improving the cell performance in terms of surface morphology, reflectivity, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements as well as Electroluminescence (EL) spectra characterizations. The highest efficiency of Cu-MCCE mc-Si solar cells subjected to such post-processing treatment process is 18.88% with short circuit current (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of 36.67\u202fmA/cm2, 638.6\u202fmV and 80.64%, respectively, in great contrast to that (16.81%) of Cu-MCCE mc-Si solar cells without any post treatment. The post-treatment process is, therefore, of great potential for the Si photovoltaic industry, especially for the Cu-MCCE mc-Si solar cells. Keywords Cu-catalyzed chemical etching mc-Si solar cell Post-treatment Polygonal chamfered cone structure 1 Introduction Low surface reflectance is the key to achieve high performance of Si-based solar cells, and it helps maximize the number of incident photons absorbed by the semiconductor and then converted into electrical energy (Yuan et al., 2009). Black silicon (BS) has drawn much attention in recent years because of its extremely low surface reflectance as well as great potential in high-efficiency Si solar cells (Cao et al., 2015a,b; Wang et al., 2015). BS could be an ideal material for Si photovoltaics due to its outstanding light management properties in the solar spectrum which benefit from a gradually changed reflective index at the silicon/air interface (Lu and Barron, 2014; Yuan et al., 2009). BS is usually fabricated by three major techniques, namely electrochemical etching, laser etching technique and reactive ion etching (Wang et al., 2017a,b; Tian et al., 2011; Levchenko et al. 2018). Among them, metal catalyzed chemical etching (MCCE) or metal assisted chemical etching (MACE) is one of the most popular methods to fabricate nanostructured black silicon due to its good controllability and low cost (Toor et al., 2016). Indeed, MCCE has also been employed as an effective way to texture diamond-wire-sawn (DWS) multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers which can\u2019t be uniformly textured by conventional acid methods (Huang et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2015a,b). Silver (Ag) has been investigated for the MCCE process because of its excellent catalytic activity and good controllability (Huang et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2016). Also, the Ag-MCCE process has been proved to be an effective way to produce black silicon and promote the conversion efficiency of such black silicon solar cells (Jiang et al., 2017). However, the introduction of Ag contamination during the Ag-MCCE process may counteract the advantages of BS and thus limit its application in the cell process. In contrast, Cu impurities have been demonstrated to be less detrimental to the silicon solar cell performance than Ag (Davis et al., 1980). As such, Cu-MCCE process has raised a great attention in recent years and is believed to be a promising method for BS (Toor et al., 2015). In particular, Liu et al. studied the mechanism of forming nanostructured porous layer on silicon surface at low Cu2+ concentration region and calibrated the etching rate in the different etching dilutions (Cao et al., 2015a,b). Wang et al. developed a Cu assisted chemical etching method for maskless texturization of c-Si with so-called inverted pyramid arrays, and the inverted pyramidal structure not only has superior light trapping characteristic but also ensures low recombination rates (Wang et al., 2015). By using the Cu-MCCE process on an industrial production line, Su et al. achieved 19.06% efficient DWS mc-Si solar cells with submicron textures, which could suppress the visibility of saw marks and color differences in the DWS mc-Si cell, solar cells with their Cu-MCCE techniques lead to a higher Voc via improved surface passivation (Zha et al., 2017). Du et al. achieved an inverted pyramid structure and met the tradeoff between the light reflection minimization and carrier recombination by adjusting the one-step Cu-assisted texturization of silicon wafer. They also demonstrated the better performance and manufacturability of such inverted pyramid structured silicon solar cells (Yang et al., 2017). However, the reported studies always focus on how to optimize the Cu-MCCE process to achieve the tradeoff between the light reflection minimization and carrier recombination but there are few studies concentrating on the post-treatment techniques after the Cu-MCCE process to improve the cell efficiency. In this work, two-step Cu-assisted MCCE method consisting of the deposition of Cu nanoparticles using Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2)/hydrofluoric acid (HF)/isopropanol (IPA) solution and the formation of Si nanostructures by HF/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution etching is utilized for the texture of the mc-Si solar cells. We systematically investigate the effect of the different parameters of etching step on the surface morphology as well as reflectivity of Si nanostructures. On this basis, a HF/nitric acid (HNO3)/phosphoric acid (H3PO4) post-processing treatment is adopted to decorate the surface of such Si nanostructures. The impact of such post-processing treatment is carefully studied in terms of surface morphology, reflectivity, cell performance, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements as well as Electroluminescence (EL) spectrum. The submicron polygonal chamfered cone structures produced by the post-processing treatment is demonstrated to be very helpful in reducing surface recombination and improving the cell performance. 2 Experimental Raw p-type DWS mc-Si wafers with a size of 156.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f156.75\u202fmm2 and a thickness of 200\u202f\u03bcm were used in this study. The wafers were first cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water in series for 10\u202fmin, and then were immersed in HF/HNO3 aqueous solution to remove cutting damage layer and rinsed in deionized water and dried by nitrogen gas. Two-step Cu-assisted chemical etching of silicon took place in a polytetrafluoroethylene containers. The mc-Si wafers were first immersed in the aqueous solution composed of Cu(NO3)2, HF, and IPA. In this process, the Cu particles were randomly deposited on the mc-Si substrates, and the function of IPA is to improve the surface activity so that the copper particles can be more easily deposited on the Si substrates. Subsequently, the wafers were etched in HF/H2O2 aqueous solution to form the nanostructure on the surface. Residual Cu nanoparticles were removed by using concentrated nitric acid for at least 20\u202fmin and alkali bath for 2\u202fmin. The silicon samples were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried by flowing nitrogen gas. After this Cu-MCCE process, a HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing step was used to form the polygonal chamfered cone structures, where H3PO4 acts as a buffering agent in the reaction. The post-treated wafers were then immersed in Potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution to smooth the structure surface. After a standard RCA cleaning, the p-n junction with a sheet resistance of \u223c90\u202f\u03a9/sq was formed by phosphorus diffusion using a Phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) source. The phosphosilicate glass that formed during phosphorus diffusion was removed by 5% HF for 120\u202fs. An \u223c80\u202fnm SiNx layer was then deposited on the surface by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to passivate the surface as well as for the antireflection function. Screen-printed aluminum paste was used as back metal contacts and screen-printed Ag grid pattern front metal contacts. The morphology and microstructure of Si nanostructures were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) (HITACHI-S4800, Chiyoda-ku, Japan). The reflectance, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured by Incident Photon to Charge Carrier Efficiency (IPCE) of solar cells measurement system (sofn, 7-SCSpec\u2161, China). The sheet resistance was tested by 4D auto four point probe meter (MODEL 280) while I-V curves of cells were measured by IV measurement system (QuickSun, 120CA-HC, Finland). Electroluminescence image was measured by EL sorting machine (zhewei, SA-220, China). 3 Results and discussion It is well known that metal particles could act as catalysts in MCCE etching process, that is the silicon beneath the metal particles can be more easily etched than the bare silicon and the driving force comes from the electrochemical reaction between Si and Cu2+/Cu for the specific Cu-MCCE process. Like the well-known metal-assisted chemical etching method (Wang et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2014), the Cu- assisted reaction can be described as two half-cell reactions namely cathode reaction (Eqs. (1) and (2)) and anode reaction (Eqs. (3) and (4)). (1) Cu2+ +2e\u2192Cu (2) H2O2 +2H+ \u21922H2O+2h+ (3) Si+2H2O\u2192SiO2 +4H+ +4e (4) SiO2 +6HF\u2192H2SiF6 +2H2O Each Cu2+ ion in the HF/Cu(NO3)2/IPA dilution can capture two electrons (e) from Si atoms because of its higher electronegativity than Si (Peng et al., 2010). For the first step, the Cu particles were deposited on the silicon substrate and the real-time SEM image of Si surface with Cu particles is presented in Fig. 1 Form both the high resolution and low resolution SEM images, one can observe that the distribution of Cu particles is uniform and compact. Furthermore, the growth rate of Cu particles show a monotonous increase with the ratio of Cu(NO3)2 in the diluted Cu(NO3)2/HF/IPA concentration (Lee et al., 1997). For the second step, the oxidized Si was etched by HF under the catalysis of Cu particles. During the etching process, apart from the oxidation process where each Cu2+ ion captures two electrons from Si atoms, Cu particles can be also oxidized by H2O2 so that silicon atoms beneath Cu particles can be strongly oxidized finally leading to the larger pits than those obtained by Ag-MCCE method. We now turn to investigate the effect of the different parameters of etching step on the surface morphology of Si nanostructures. Fig. 2 illustrates surface morphologies of Si nanostructures produced by Cu-MCCE method under different amount of HF from 0.25\u202fM to 0.75\u202fM in the etching solution with fixed etching time of 4\u202fmin. The larger amount of HF used here is to reduce the etching time compared with the reported etching condition (Lee et al., 2011). It is clear that both the density and the depth of the Si pores increase monotonously as the HF amount increases from 0.25\u202fM to 0.75\u202fM. This is probably due to the rise in the number of the reaction points on the silicon surface with increasing amount of HF. For low HF amount case as shown in Fig. 2a, the Si pits dispersed sparsely on the surface and the pits size was uniform, while the density of pits increase and the pits convert to deep holes as the amount of HF increase to a high value as displayed in Fig. 2c and d. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of Si nanostructures under different H2O2 amount with fixed HF amount of 0.375\u202fM, H2O amount of 50\u202fM and etching time of 4\u202fmin in the etching step. One can clearly observe that both the density and depth of Si pores decrease with the increase of H2O2 amount, meaning that the increased amount of H2O2 may slow down the etching rate. In general, the more time the Si substrate is etched, the larger density of Si pores and the deeper depth of Si pores (Chartier et al., 2008). Therefore, the reflectivity of such Si nanostructures produced by MCCE method will become lower and lower as the etching time increases. Our results on the reflectivity of Si nanostructures produced by Cu-MCCE method under different etching time are shown in Fig. 4 is in good agreement with this law. The lowest reflectivity at visible wavelength can even reach 12% for the one etched for 6\u202fmin. For two step Ag-MCCE etching process, apart from the deposition of Ag particles and digging holes (Chartier et al., 2008), a serial of post processing steps are of the same importance, because the increased surface area will introduce more recombination and the rough structure can\u2019t match the subsequent process, making such BS structure not suitable for direct application in the cell production. Therefore, we also adopt a HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment to modify the Si nanostructure. Fig. 5 a\u2013d show the SEM images of Si nanostructures produced by Cu-MCCE method before and after such post-treatment process, respectively. It is obvious that the Si nanostructures change from Si pores without any post-treatment to irregular polygonal chamfered cones after such post-treatment process. Moreover, no obvious Cu particles were observed for both cases due to the dissolution of Cu particles during the etching solution (Zha et al., 2017). From Fig. 5c we can observe that the density of the polygon chamfered cone structure is highly uniform and the average size is about 600\u2013800\u202fnm. The high resolution image shown in Fig. 5d reflects that the polygonal chamfered cone structure has six sides and flat bottom. Such large size polygonal chamfered cone structure is beneficial in reducing surface recombination and matching with the subsequent process. Fig. 5e and f display the schematics of post-processing treatment. The small pores enlarge along the original edges and merge together into larger ones after the post-treatment. The principle of antireflection in this unique structure is based on two theories. One is the gradient effect of refractive index. The refractive index varies from top to bottom for such Si polygonal chamfered cone structure and this is equal to having several antireflection layers to decrease the light reflection. To clearly explain its light trapping properties, the textured mc-Si wafer can be treated as a multilayer of Si-air binary, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Such a multilayer also can be thought of as a medium with a gradient refractive index and impedance, which can smoothly connect the air and the Si substrate. (Cao et al., 2015). The other is the well-known geometric reflection which means that the light can reflect several times between the different sides of the structure. Our polygonal chamfered cone structure possesses more sides so that the incident light can reflect more times, one more reflection means more light absorption and the lower reflectivity (Yang et al., 2017). Therefore, this special micron light-trapping structure can make better use of the light energy. It is worth noticing that no Cu particles can be observed in the SEM images. This is vastly significant for the manufacture of Si solar cells, since metal particles like Ag and Cu are destructive to the performance of Si solar cells. The main characteristics of four typical DWS mc-Si solar cells subjected to the HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment with different treatment time (SA0s, SA90s, SA120s and SA180s) are detailed in Table 1. Here, SA0s represents the cell fabricated by the Cu-MCCE method and the standard process for mc-Si solar cells without any post-processing treatment, while SA 90s, SA120s and SA180s represent the cells fabricated by the same Cu-MCCE method and standard process as well as such post-processing treatment under 90\u202fs, 120\u202fs and 180\u202fs respectively. The solar cell area is 156.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f156.75\u202fmm2 under air mass (AM) 1.5G illumination. From Table 1, one can see that the cell performance can be greatly improved via such HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment. The best performance was achieved on the SA120s post-treated cell, with the highest conversion efficiency (\u03b7) of 18.88%, the maximum short circuit current (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of 36.67\u202fmA/cm2, 638.6\u202fmV and 80.64%, respectively. However, with the further increase in post-treatment time like 180\u202fs, the cell performance including conversion efficiency, Voc and Isc would degrade gradually. The reflectivity of four typical DWS mc-Si solar cells subjected to the HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment with different treatment time (SA0s, SA90s, SA120s and SA180s) as a function of wavelength are shown in Fig. 7 a. Although the untreated cell (SA0s) has the lowest reflectivity at wavelength between 300 and 1100\u202fnm, its cell performance is also the worst as well. This can be well understood since black silicon nanostructures with high aspect ratio often introduce more recombination due to the increased surface area (Oh et al., 2012). The untreated cell (SA0s) has more surface area than the post-treated cells, which introduces more surface recombination and thus accounts for the poor performance. The other possible reason for the inferior performance is that Si pores and caters produced by Cu-MCCE method are so deep, leading to both the poor quality of the p-n junction formed by POCL3 diffusion and the mismatch between the Si nanostructure surface and the deposited SiNx by PECVD. The above results can be further supported by both IQE and EQE of these four cells shown in Fig. 7b and c, respectively. The untreated cell (SA0s) has the lowest EQE and IQE values because of more surface recombination in comparison with the post-treated cells (Chartier et al., 2008). Furthermore, the post-treated cell with a treatment time of 120\u202fs (SA120s) has the highest EQE value, reflecting the highest cell performance as shown in both Table 1 and Fig. 7d. EL spectrum is often used to characterize potential recombination defects in the Si solar cells or cell modules. Fig. 8 presents the EL spectra of four typical DWS mc-Si solar cells subjected to the HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment with different treatment time (SA0s, SA90s, SA120s and SA180s). From the EL spectrum of the untreated cell (SA0s), we can observe many black spots and wires, which can be related to the defects or remaining metal contaminations. This is why poor cell performance was achieved for the untreated cell due to more carriers\u2019 recombination. However, after the HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment, such black wires or spots rarely emerge especially for the cells after 120\u202fs or 180\u202fs treatment (SA120s and SA180s) as shown in Fig. 8c and d. This improvement can be also attributed to the high compatibility of such Si polygonal chamfered cone structures with the p-n junction formation, the deposition of PECVD-SiNx as well as screen printing. 4 Conclusion In summary, two-step Cu-MCCE etching method consisting of the deposition of Cu nanoparticles using Cu(NO3)2/HF/IPA solution and the formation of Si nanostructures by HF/H2O2 solution etching has been utilized for the texture of the DWS mc-Si solar cells. We systematically investigate the effect of the different parameters of etching solution on the surface morphology as well as reflectivity of Si nanostructures. On this basis, a HF/HNO3/H3PO4 post-processing treatment is adopted to decorate the surface of such Si nanostructures. We have demonstrated that the submicron polygonal chamfered cone structure produced by our post-processing treatment is helpful in reducing surface recombination and improving the cell performance in terms of surface morphology, reflectivity, IQE and EQE measurements as well as EL spectra characterizations. The highest efficiency of Cu-MCCE mc-Si solar cells subjected to such post-processing treatment possess is 18.88% with Isc, Voc and FF of 36.67\u202fmA/cm2, 638.6\u202fmV and 80.64%, respectively, in great contrast to that (16.81%) of Cu-MCCE mc-Si solar cells without any post treatment. The physical reason can be attributed to both the less surface recombination because of less surface area of special Si polygonal chamfered cone structures and the high compatibility of such Si nanostructures with the p-n junction formation, the deposition of PECVD-SiNx as well as screen printing. As such, our post-processing treatment process is promising in producing high-efficiency mc-Si solar cells based on Cu-MCCE method.
