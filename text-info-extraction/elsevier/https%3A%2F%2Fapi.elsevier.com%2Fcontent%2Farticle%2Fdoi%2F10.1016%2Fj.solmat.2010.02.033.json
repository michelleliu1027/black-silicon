We report a simple approach to prepare cost effective antireflective surface directly on silicon wafers, which consists of arrays of vertically aligned silicon nanowires (VA-SiNWA). Large area VA-SiNWA were realized by silver induced wet chemical etching of p-silicon (100) substrates in aqueous HF and AgNO3 solution at room temperature. Length of Si wires (diameter in 50\u2013300nm range) was found to increase linearly with etching time (0\u2013120min). A remarkable reduction in reflectivity (R \u03bb ) for surfaces with Si wires was observed. The value of R \u03bb less than 2% was realized in the 300\u2013600nm wavelength range in the case of \u223c12\u03bcm long Si wires, a value better than the best R \u03bb reported in anisotropically textured surface or single layer antireflection coatings. The VA-SiNWA behaves as a subwavelength structured surface that could suppress the reflectivity to a great extent. Such surfaces may have potential applications as antireflection surface for silicon solar cells. Keywords Silicon nanowires Metal induced etching Black silicon Antireflective coatings (ARC) 1 Introduction Surface antireflection techniques are important for improving the performance of many optical and optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, planar displays, videos, camera monitors, and light sensors [1\u20133]. For example, flat silicon surfaces have high reflectivity (35\u201340%) with a strong spectral dependence, which limits the power conversion efficiency of silicon based solar cells. Usually, transparent quarter wavelength layers of SiO x , TiO x , or Si x N y with intermediate or gradient refractive indices are used as antireflection coatings (ARC) [4]. ARC is formed by single or multiple layer film deposition through various processes such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, sputtering processes, wet coating, sol-gel methods, etc.. These coatings have resonant structures and work effectively only in a limited spectral range and for specific angles of incidence [4]. Also, these coatings have several problems such as thermal mismatch, adhesiveness, stability, etc. In the case of silicon solar cells, a variety of other approaches have also been developed to minimize the reflection losses through modifying surface morphology [3\u20136] wherein reflection losses in a broad spectral range are reduced by surface texturing by anisotropic etching generally in aqueous alkaline solution. However, this process is limited to single crystalline silicon only [4,7]. An alternate approach to minimize reflectivity (R \u03bb ) utilizes a fine surface textured surface, comprising features on the nanometer scale. Porous silicon (PS) is one such approach to reduce R \u03bb in the range of 5\u20138% [8,9]. However, reproduction and fragile nature of the PS layer have always been a matter of concern [6]. Recently, antireflection surfaces based on subwavelength structures (SWSs) have also been investigated [10]. The SWSs are the surface relief structures with dimensions smaller than the wavelength of the incident light. An SWS surface with a deep and tapered profile can suppress the Fresnel reflection substantially over a wide spectral bandwidth. These layers are intrinsically more stable than multilayer ARCs since no layers of foreign materials are involved. It has been shown that optical thickness of the SWS layer to wavelength ratio greater than 0.4 drastically reduces reflection losses and the R \u03bb approaches zero though it fluctuates slightly at times on further increase of the SWS height [11,12]. For ideal SWSs with near zero reflectivity requires perfectly tapered V-shaped grooves of the SWSs [13]. To date, different methods have been employed to fabricate SWS surfaces [10\u201315]. Dry etching methods such as reactive ion etching, nanoimprint lithography, etc. are commonly used for the fabrication of SWSs, in which imprinting or shadow masks with resolutions in subwavelength scale are required [10,12,13,16,17]. The masks can be obtained by electron beam lithography (EBL) [10], by laser interference lithography [12, 16], self-assembly like alumina template [13] or from nature materials [17]. However, the low throughput and the cost, for example of the EBL, are of great concerns [10,18]. On the other hand, interference lithography [19,20] and nanoimprint lithography [16] enable the creation of antireflective SWS over large areas but are complex and expensive, hence limiting their applications. In this paper, we propose a simple, low cost process to produce antireflective surface consisting of vertically aligned silicon nanowires arrays (VA-SiNWA), which clearly resembles SWSs surface. The Si wires are fabricated at room temperature through metal-induced selective etching of silicon wafers in aqueous HF solution [21]. The growth and morphology of VA-SiNWA and the corresponding reflectivity of the silicon surface with etching time have been investigated and are correlated with the surface morphology. 2 Experiment Growth of VA-SiNWA was carried out on (100) p-type (1\u20135\u03a9cm), chemically\u2013mechanically polished (CMP), B-doped crystalline silicon wafers. The etching of 300\u00b110\u03bcm thick wafers was carried out in a teflon vessel containing 5molL\u22121 aqueous HF solution and 0.02molL\u22121 AgNO3 at room temperature for different etching times. Prior to etching, silicon wafers were sequentially cleaned with acetone, de-ionized water, and boiled in piranha solution (H2SO4: H2O2=3:1 by volume for 30min) followed by rinsing with de-ionized water and 5% HF dip to remove oxide. The cleaned silicon wafers were etched for different time durations keeping all other parameters such as concentration of the solution, volume, temperature, etc. constant. The samples surfaces obtained after etching were found to be wrapped with a thick silver (Ag) layer, which consisted of high density tree-like dendritic structures. To remove the Ag layer completely, the as-prepared samples were treated in a conventional Ag etchant solution consisting of NH3OH: H2O2 in the ratio of 3:1 by volume and were rinsed with de-ionized water. After being blown dry in air they were subjected to further investigations. Morphology of the samples was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (LEO model 440VP) and the reflectivity measurements were carried out by spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-UV model 3101PC) in the 300\u20131100nm wavelength range. 3 Results and discussion Typical SEM images of etched silicon wafer are shown in Fig. 1. The low magnification top view of the silicon surface etched for 45min is shown in Fig. 1a and the corresponding cross-sectional view in the inset. The highly magnified and tilted view of the sample is shown in Fig. 1b. The SEM images indicate that etched silicon wafers consist of dense and vertically aligned one-dimensional nanostructures (VA-SiNWA). From the top tilted view of SEM image shown, surface relief structures with dimensions less than the wavelength of visible light could be seen. The diameters of the Si wires are estimated to be in the range of 50\u2013300nm by SEM investigations. With increasing etching time, length of the nanowires increased from few nanometers to several micrometers depending on the etching time. The dimensions of the nanostructures, particularly the diameter, remain almost the same throughout the length as can be seen from Fig. 2a and b for etching times of 5 and 45min where the nanowires length are \u223c1 and \u223c12\u03bcm, respectively. It has been found that the length (as determined from cross-sectional view of SEM images) of Si wires increases linearly with etching time for durations (0\u2013120min), and arrays length vs. etching time curve is shown in Fig. 2c. The estimated average etching rate is \u223c250nmmin\u22121 for HF and AgNO3 concentration of 5 and 0.02molL\u22121, respectively, at 300K. The plot clearly indicates that VA-SiNWA of tunable length can be fabricated at room temperature by controlling the etching time. Fig. 3a\u2013d shows the SEM images (top and tilted view) of VA-SiNWA surfaces fabricated for 2, 5, 15, and 45min where regions with bright contrast correspond to un-etched silicon surface and with black contrast to the etched regions of the samples. Fig. 3a shows uniformly distributed nanostructures of low dimensions across the whole area at the onset of etching process. With increase in etching time, etched regions seem to sink deeper and deeper, resulting in the evolution of un-etched silicon regions as one-dimensional structure with diameter in nanometer scale. As the etching progresses, etching of nanowires may also take place due to etching from the top surfaces of the wires that result in the increase of porosity, particularly in the region that are exposed to the etching solutions for longer durations (i.e. close to the top surface). It is noted that with increase in wire length, porosity is more at the top compared to its value at the bottom (Fig. 3d). The porosity was estimated by the image processing method (i.e. top un-etched surface area) of SEM images. The porosity vs. etching time is shown in the inset of Fig. 3b, which shows sharp increase in porosity initially and tend to slow down for larger etching times. The top region porosity was estimated to be \u223c32% in the sample etched for 2min whereas its value increased to \u223c65% for the sample etched for 45min. It is important to point out that porosity at the Si nanowires\u2013Si substrate interface should remain almost the same (\u223c32%) in all the samples etched for different time durations. It is expected since the density of silicon nanowires attached to the silicon surface remains almost the same with increase in etching duration as is evident from the cross-sectional view of the nanowires shown in Fig. 2a and b. In addition, it is evident that after a certain length, the nanowires could not support themselves to stand vertically of their own and lean over surrounding wires for support, resulting in agglomeration of nanowires in the top region (Figs. 2b and 3d). The graded porosity with increase in Si wires length may also be attributed to the surface tensional and van der Walls forces acting among the nanowires, which may hold them together in the top region to form the pyramidal shape structures (see Fig. 1b), similar to agglomeration of a shaving brush after rinsing with water. Further, the presence of defects in wafers may also lead to such morphology. However, the exact mechanism is not clear and needs further investigations. The growth mechanism of VA-SiNWA has been widely studied [21,22]. The mechanism of VA-SiNWA formation can be understood as being a self-assembled Ag induced selective etching process based on the localized microscopic electrochemical cell model proposed by Peng et al. [21]. The process is based on the continuous galvanic displacement of Si by Ag+ via Ag+\u2192Ag reduction on the silicon surface and hence forming many local nano-electrochemical cells. The Ag nanoparticles deposited act as active cathode and silicon surface in contact with the Ag nanoparticles as active anode. The whole reaction can be divided into two parts: cathode and anode reactions, which are described as follows [21]: Cathodic reaction: Ag++e\u2212(VB)\u2192Ag\u00b0(s) Anodic reaction: Si(s)+2H2O\u2192SiO2+4H++4e\u2212(VB) SiO2(s)+6HF\u2192H2SiF6+2H2O In brief, Ag+ ions get reduced to Ag onto the silicon surface by injecting holes into the Si valence band and oxidizing the silicon surface locally in contact with Ag. The oxidized wafer surface is subsequently etched away by HF. The initial reduction of Ag+ results in Ag nanoclusters, which restricts the oxidation of silicon surface and the etching process occurs locally. The deposited Ag nanoclusters are uniformly distributed throughout the silicon surface at the initial stage. Further reduction of Ag+ occurs on the Ag nanoclusters itself (being relatively highly electronegative than silicon and hence provide easy injection path for holes) being an active cathode by electron transfer from the underlying wafer, not from the un-etched Si surface. Hence, self-assembly of Ag nanoclusters to the dendritic structure and lack of coalescence to a compact grain Ag film causes a selective oxidation and dissolution of Si in the aqueous HF-AgNO3 solution. The Ag nanoparticles trapped in pores sink continuously, thus resulting in the wire like Si-structure. The etched silicon wafers (>2min etching) after removing the silver layer appeared dark black, which is indicative of low surface reflectivity. This motivated us to investigate the reflectivity property of surfaces consisting of VA-SiNWA structure. Fig. 4 shows the comparative spectral reflectivity plot of single-crystalline silicon wafers etched for different times (0 to 45min). It is observed that R \u03bb decreases with increase in etching time (i.e. with increasing wire length) and reaches a minimum of \u223c1.5% in the 300\u2013600nm range and <4% in the spectral range 600\u20131000nm in the samples etched for 15min or more. An optical photograph of the VA-SiNWA sample prepared for 45min is shown in the inset of Fig. 4 along with that of a polished silicon surface for comparison. Fig. 5 compares the reflectivity of VA-SiNWA with that of the anisotropically textured silicon surface, textured along with Si x N y coating and porous silicon ARCs [7,23], which clearly shows the superiority of the VA-SiNWA as an antireflection surface. The superior antireflection property of nanowires array surface can be attributed to the following: (i) the nanowires arrays have structural morphology similar to SWSs surface as shown schematically in Fig. 6a, which can suppress the reflection loss over a wide spectral range [10\u201314], (ii) the nanowires array surface has varying porosity from top (air\u2013Si nanowires interface) to the bottom end of the nanowires (nanowires\u2013Si substrate interface) where the porosity gradient causes a graded refractive index layer from top to bottom (refractive index \u2018n\u2019 increases with decrease in porosity) as shown schematically in Fig. 6b [3,6,24]which closely resembles a multilayer antireflection coating [25], and (iii) highly rough surfaces and network assembly of the nanowires may lead to strong light scattering and consequently its absorption. Fig. 7 shows that the reflectivity of the VA-SiNWA at 600nm wavelength with different etching times has no significant reduction in R \u03bb for more than 25min etching and has a direct co-relation with porosity data (inset of Fig. 3b). Fluctuation in R \u03bb is observed in the samples etched for longer time durations. We intend to use Si nanowires based substrates for solar cells application where long wires may not be suitable due to their fragile nature. A process for solar cell fabrication of Si nanowires based black silicon substrates is being developed and the preliminary results on cell performance have been reported [26] where efficiency of the nanowires based solar cell was less compared to the control cell with a planar surface. These cells were fabricated on substrates with Si wires array of desired length over the entire active device area using the following methodology. The n+\u2013p\u2013p+ structure based solar cells on substrate fully covered with nanowires were fabricated by conventional cell fabrication protocol involving phosphorus diffusion followed by alloying of a thin Al layer deposited on the rear surface to form back surface field. The front and back metal contacts were made by Ti/Ag and Al, respectively. The control cell having CMP surface was also processed in the same batch. The metal contacts formation on the VA-SiNWA surface has been a major problem, which was one of the reasons for the lower performance of Si wires based cells compared to the control cell. This problem has been alleviated by selective growth of the nanowires on the front protecting the regions, where bus bars and fingers of cells are to be made, using an etch resist coating. As a result, the electrode area remains planar similar to the control cell and the active area is covered with the nanowires. It was found that 5\u03bcm long Si wires may be sufficient to achieve reflectivity around 2\u20133%. The cell made on selectively grown VA-SiNWA surfaces has resulted in a significant improvement in short circuit current density (15\u201320% with respect to the control cell). The open circuit voltage was found \u223c2\u20134% lower compared to the control cell which may be attributed to enhanced recombination loss due to manifold increase in the surface area after the nanowire formation. It is important to mention that fill factor of the two cells was comparable. The efficiency of the Si wires based cells was 10\u201315% more compared to the control cell, which could be primarily due to improvement in short circuit current. The process optimization, particularly the issues related with the surface recombination losses associated with enhanced surface area, nanowire length, etc. is being carried out and will be reported elsewhere. 4 Conclusions We have demonstrated the growth of large area VA-SiNWA similar to SWSs by a simple and inexpensive process known as silver induced electroless etching of silicon, which minimizes reflection loss to as low as \u223c2% in the spectral range of interest for silicon solar cells. The surface acts as a tunable antireflection layer that is controlled by the nanowires length. The process is simple and scalable for fabrication of Si wires on large area and could easily be adopted in silicon device process technology. We have made silicon solar cells on VA-SiNWA based substrates that show interesting results in terms of enhanced short circuit current density and hence the cell efficiency without affecting other solar cell performance parameters.
