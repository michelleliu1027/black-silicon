Black silicon (b-Si) with nanotextures is a promising light-trapping scheme for potentially achieving high conversion efficiency at reduced manufacturing cost in crystalline-silicon solar cells. However, the inherently high aspect-ratio and tiny feature size of the nanostructures are subject to severe surface (large surface areas) and Auger recombination (worse doping profile). These will abate the cost values of b-Si since one has to adopt a comprise strategy of applying shallow nanotextures with antireflection and passivation layers. Here, we show that silicon microwire solar cells featuring well-defined radial junctions can extensively suppress both surface and Auger recombination by providing excellent all-around electrical field. The radially doped silicon micropillar devices even show an internal quantum efficiency as good as that of planar substrate and their measured minority carrier lifetimes become nearly independent of total surface area. A great reduction in short-circuit current density loss was further identified as the junction abruptly changed from a fully diffused to a core-shell configuration, manifesting the powerful effectiveness of radial p-n+ junction on the suppression of Auger recombination. Furthermore, silicon microwire solar cell with a radial junction demonstrates 37% increase in efficiency compared with the reference cell, suggesting a feasible strategy towards high-efficiency solar devices. Graphical abstract fx1 Keywords Radial junction Micropencil array Surface recombination Auger recombination Black silicon solar cells 1 Introduction Black silicon (b-Si) that employs sub-wavelength surface nanotexturing is a very effective way of eliminating front-surface reflection in solar cells without the need of additional antireflection coating [1,2]. In addition, b-Si can be fabricated by cost-effective methods, such as metal-assisted etching and laser modification. So applying b-Si in Si solar cells could be an ideal strategy to boost efficiency as well as to reduce the manufacturing cost. However, the implementation of b-Si in a front-junction solar cell is inherently associated with problems, i.e., larger parasitic surface areas, worse doping profiles (heavily diffused throughout the entire depth of the nanotextures), leading to parallel recombination channels in the emitter: surface and Auger recombination [3,4]. Oh et al. [5] have thoroughly examined the influences of these two recombination channels on the performance of b-Si solar cells and drawn two key points towards high efficiency: keeping shallow depth and moderate doping level. Since then, these golden-rules have always been strictly obeyed by both fundamental researchers and industrial engineers, irrespective of the sacrifices in light-trapping property due to the adoption of shallow nanotextures (300\u2013400\u202fnm) [6]. The insufficient short-circuit current density (J sc) resulted in unsatisfied efficiencies of below 18%. Additional antireflection layer (SiNx) was then still needed to boost the efficiency beyond 20%. Subsequent breakthrough came from Savin et al. [7] where they demonstrated a conformal Al2O3 coating can provide excellent chemical and electrical passivation to the b-Si nanotextures. Relying on the ultralow surface recombination velocity (S eff ~\u202f20\u202fcm\u202fs\u22121) endowed by an 80\u202fnm Al2O3 film on a b-Si surface (dual functions with passivation and antireflection), extremely high efficiency above 22% was resulted based on an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) cell. Nevertheless, the Auger recombination in b-Si that was perfectly surmounted in IBC cells, is still an unsurpassed issue in conventional front-junction solar cells where highly-doped emitter must be formed upon the nanotextures. In contrast to nanotextures, vertically aligned microwires with well-defined diameters and pitches are particularly attractive for achieving high-performance solar cells due to the excellent light-trapping property as well as the capability of forming radially core-shell p-n+ junctions [8]. By well adjusting the size of the microwire arrays and the parameters of the diffusion process, a radial emitter with junction depth (~500\u202fnm) and sheet resistance (<100\u202f\u03a9\u202fsq\u22122) both similar to that of the state-of-the-art planar Si solar cells could be formed [9\u201311]. Efficient carrier collection and mitigated Auger recombination are therefore highly expected in the core-shell junction configuration, because of a short pathway and a surrounding electrical field with controllable strength [12]. Moreover, silicon microwire solar cell may offer an ideal platform for the development of efficient solar-to-fuel device, a concept of directly turning solar energy into storable fuel [13,14]. The unique features favorable for solar-to-fuel devices consist (1) the sidewalls of microwires provide a large surface area for abundant loading of catalysts, (2) radial junction geometry results in accelerated electron transport between catalysts and silicon absorber. However, by now how the dimensions including height, width, and pitch of microwires, associated with doping temperatures, affect the core-shell junction geometry has not been fully explored. A fundamental understanding of the junction depth and doping level on the surface and Auger recombination losses has rarely been quantified. This leads to poor control and optimization on the aspects of the design and fabrication of radial junction silicon microwire solar cells, hindering their applications in both photovoltaics and solar-to-fuel devices since the unsatisfied efficiencies. Actually, pencil-like Si nanotexture (nanopencil) arrays with averaged reflectivity below 5% have been demonstrated by our group utilizing a facile wet-chemistry fabrication scheme [15,16]. We previously applied this nanopencil structure in b-Si solar cells, but only a poor efficiency of ~10% was achieved because of the abovementioned recombination issues [17]. Relying on similar wet chemical etching process, it is easy to fabricate micro-sized pencil (micropencil) arrays with tunable pitch, diameter and height, rendering us a platform to successfully construct radial junction Si solar cells and study the effects from junction depth and geometric parameters. In this paper, the electrical performance of radially phosphorus-doped microwire arrays on p-type Si (p-Si) substrates was thoroughly investigated by experiments and simulations, with the variations of height (1\u20138\u202f\u00b5m), diameter (1 and 2\u202f\u00b5m) and junction depth (controlled by the diffusion temperature ranging from 800 to 950\u202f\u00b0C). We showed that a superior radial p-n+ junction can be formed at diffusion temperature of 825\u202f\u00b0C, of which the 2.4\u202f\u00b5m (pitch) micropillars even showed an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) as good as that of planar substrate. More interestingly, we found that the minority carrier lifetime becomes nearly independent of the total surface areas (changing the micropillars depth from 1 to 8\u202f\u00b5m) once a radial junction was formed. As a result, the modified radial p-n+ junction solar cell obtained an enhancement of up to 37% in efficiency compared with the fully-doped reference cell. Our findings fully explored the superiorities of radial junctions in suppressing both surface and Auger recombination, which may provide a new direction towards high-efficiency microtextured solar cells and solar-to-fuel cells. 2 Results and discussion Firstly, we fabricated three-dimensional Si microstructures with two kinds of pitches, 1.2 and 2.4\u202f\u03bcm, via an anisotropic wet etching technique (see Methods). Fig. 1(a\u2013f) demonstrated the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of as-fabricated micropillar and micropencil arrays with 1.2\u202f\u03bcm-pitch, and the corresponding solar spectrum averaged reflectance (R AVE) was shown in Fig. 1g (The samples with 2.4\u202f\u00b5m-pitch were shown in Fig. S1). Note that the ratio of diameter/pitch for all the samples was preset as 1/1.2 according to our previous experiences [16], aiming to obtain a better light-trapping effect. While the aspect ratios of height/diameter were changed from 1 to 4. The microstructure arrays have smooth sidewalls and preferable uniformity, thanks to the improvement of the metal catalyst system and etching solution. As illustrated in Fig. 1g, with increasing the height beyond 1\u202f\u00b5m, the R AVE of pillar samples kept at a stable value (~11%), due to the strong reflection from the relatively large flat portions on the top [18,19]. In contrast, the R AVE of pencil samples was greatly decreased from 12.5% to 1.6% with the increase of height from 1 to 4\u202f\u00b5m, demonstrating more efficient light-trapping properties of tapered configurations [16]. It should be mentioned that the reflection from the basal open area may also become weaker with the increase of pencil height, especially for depth higher than 2\u202f\u03bcm. Therefore, the aspect ratio of pencil arrays should be kept over 2 to suppress the reflection below 5%. The antireflection property is one of important factors for high efficiency solar cells. Surface recombination, which is always relevant to the surface area, is another crucial factor. A F and A proj were defined here to represent the micro-textured front surface area and the corresponding projected area (equal to the planar area of the polished wafer), respectively. The ratio of A F/A proj [5] that was labeled on the top edge of Fig. 1g reveals the enhancement of surface area of micropillar arrays. For the micropillar, the A F/A proj increases from 2.26 to 6.04 with the growth of height from 1 to 4 \u00b5m. Here, radial p-n+ junctions covered with thermal-grown SiO2 layers, as schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 1h, were utilized to evaluate the quality of surface passivation. The lifetime measurement gives an effective carrier lifetime (\u03c4 eff) including the contributions from both bulk lifetime (\u03c4 bulk) and surface lifetime (represented by front and back surface recombination velocity, S F eff and S B eff,). That is 1/\u03c4 eff = 1/\u03c4 bulk + (S F eff + S B eff)/W, where W is the wafer thickness. For same batch of p-Si wafers with identical rear-surface configurations (planar surface coated with SiO2), the change in \u03c4 eff therefore mainly reflected the passivation quality of front surface (different microstructures coated with SiO2). The corresponding \u03c4 eff for different front-side designs were collected and shown in Fig. 1(h and i) [7]. It revealed that the five samples in Fig. 1h have similar \u03c4 eff in a large span of excess carrier densities (from 1014 to 1016 cm\u22123). For a fair comparison, the lifetime of each texture at a universal excess carrier density (1 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22123) was extracted and shown in Fig. 1i. Surprisingly, the effective lifetime of the micropillar samples are nearly independent of the area ratios of A F/A proj, and even comparable to the values from planar and pyramidal samples. According to the equation of S F eff\u2261S F loc\u00b7A F/A proj, surface recombination should largely depend on surface area, where S F loc is the local effective surface recombination velocity at the front surface [5]. Therefore, the less difference of \u03c4 eff for different A F/A proj indicates that the surface recombination should become a secondary factor. For example, assuming S F loc = 1 cm/s and \u03c4 bulk = 250 \u03bcs for our wafer (W = 400 \u00b5m), \u03c4 eff = 248 and 241 \u03bcs can be calculated for planar (A F/A proj = 1) and pillar 4 (A F/A proj = 6), respectively. At this situation, with a good surface passivation, the \u03c4 eff becomes nearly independent to the surface areas. Therefore, the actually measured lifetime of 202/219 \u03bcs for pillar 4/planar indicates a pretty good surface passivation for microstructures. On the other hands, nanowire structure exhibited a remarkable negative relevant relation between the effective lifetime and the area ratio of A F/A proj, indicating severe surface recombination [5,20]. In reference 5, the effective minority carrier lifetime in SiO2 passivated b-Si was found rapidly dropped from ~220 to ~110 \u03bcs as increasing the A F/A proj from 2.9 to 5.2 [5]. This indicates a different passivation mechanism of microstructures compared to that of nanostructures, which will be discussed in next section. Additionally, IQE spectra will give more information of spatially resolved extraction capability on photogenerated carriers. Thus IQE becomes a passivation-quality-dependent parameter indicative of the surface and Auger recombination because of the elimination of effects from light-trapping properties. The Auger recombination from the front n+ doped layer can be well evaluated by the IQE spectra at short wavelength range while the surface recombination is relevant to full spectra. As shown in Fig. 2a, the IQE responses of larger pitch (2.4 \u03bcm) micropillar that was doped at 850 \u00b0C was firstly examined aiming to study the influence of A F/A proj on the surface recombination. Note that the purpose of choosing larger pitch and medium doping temperature is to largely reduce the influence of Auger recombination (details will be described in Fig. 5). One can see from Fig. 2a that the IQE values of 2.4 \u00b5m-pitch micropillars were well maintained with the increase of aspect ratio. This trend coincides with the results of the effective carrier lifetime, indicating that the microwire radial p-n+ junction may play a crucial role in the surface passivation. Meanwhile, the IQE spectra in the blue spectrum range (from 400 to 500 nm) even showed a little enhancement as increasing the height from 2 to 8 \u00b5m, manifesting a possible superiority of radial p-n+ junctions in shortening the length of the carrier collection [21,22]. The influence of doping temperature on the IQE spectra for front configurations with planar substrate, 2.4 \u03bcm-pitch micropillars and 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropillars were further studied and shown in Fig. 2(b\u2013d), respectively. One can clearly find the IQE in blue spectra range for the same structure decreases along with the elevation of doping temperature. More importantly, this decline tendency becomes much prominent with the decrease of structures\u2019 pitch (planar counterpart can be considered here as infinite pitch). For example, the IQE value at 400 nm wavelength for the planar device (Fig. 2b) reduced from 100% to 82% as doping temperature increased from 825 \u00b0C to 875 \u00b0C, while the IQE at same wavelength for the 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropillars was found decreased from 90% at 825 \u00b0C to 22% at 875 \u00b0C (Fig. 2d). The reduced IQE mentioned above could be roughly attributed to the deteriorated Auger recombination in the heavy doping region, which would become more serious with the growth of doping depth and concentration at elevated doping temperature [23]. The abrupt decline in IQE spectra in Fig. 2d may indicate a transformation of the junction configuration in the 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropillars, i.e. from a core-shell p-n+ junction to all \u2018dead layer\u2019 structure (heavily diffused throughout the entire depth of the pillars). Numerical simulations were further implemented to mimic the possible transformation process in junction configurations of 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropencil structures under different doping temperatures. More information about the simulation can refer the details in the Method of Simulation. To well match with the experimental results, the doping information used in this simulation was extracted from the experimental data and we assumed an ideal case of a uniform doping layer along with the surface of structure. Fig. 3a depicted the dopant concentration as a function of depth for the planar structures at different doping temperatures. According to the experience that Auger recombination commonly predominates the recombination process when the dopant concentration (N d) exceeds 1 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123 [24], it is easy to find that the thickness of high Auger recombination layer increases from 0.15 to 1.1 \u00b5m as the doping temperatures rise from 800 \u00b0C to 950 \u00b0C. If considering the N d > 1 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123 as \u2018dead layer\u2019, as shown in Fig. 3c, one can clearly see that the all \u2018dead layer\u2019 structures of 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropencil will be formed when the doping temperatures exceed 900 \u00b0C. In order to intuitively state the Auger recombination in the doping process, the profile of the Auger recombination rate was simulated. The net Auger recombination rate is defined by (1) R Auger = R hhe + R eeh = C p p 2 n \u2013 n i 2 p 0 + C n p n 2 \u2013 n i 2 n 0 where C p and C n are the separate Auger coefficients, p 0/n 0 and p/n are the hole/electron densities under thermal equilibrium for the dark and illumination case, respectively, n i is the intrinsic carrier density. Thus, n = n 0 + \u0394n and p = p 0 + \u0394n, where \u0394n is the excess carrier density, which depends on the photogenerated carriers. As shown in Fig. 3b, we showed the cross-sectional distribution of concentration of photogenerated carriers (G) at \u03bb = 400 nm for the planar counterpart and 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropencil. The penetration depth at \u03bb = 400 nm for the planar sample is ~2 \u00b5m, which means it can well expose the recombination information inside the structure for the pencil sample described above. Since the doping temperatures have a direct effect on the doping concentration (N d) as shown in Fig. 3a, we then discussed the carriers\u2019 distribution under thermal equilibrium. Obviously, with the increase of doping temperatures, heavy-doping region fulfill the structures gradually as shown in Fig. 3c, which maintains high consistency with the measured doping concentration in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3d showed the corresponding cross-sectional distribution of Auger recombination rate (R Auger) for the two structures at \u03bb = 400 nm. As the doping temperature increased, more photogenerated carriers were involved in \u2018dead layer\u2019, leading to severe Auger recombination. To help understand the difference between the all \u2018dead layer\u2019 structure and the radial p-n+ junction structure in suppressing surface and Auger recombination, schematics of excess carrier recombination mechanisms were proposed in Fig. 4. We directly compared the structures with nano- and micro-dimensions, shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Here we assumed both structures underwent the same doping condition and received a uniform p-n+ junction with depth of 150 nm. In this case, the entire nanostructures with the diameter of 200 nm become all \u2018dead layer\u2019 (Fig. 4a), while the microstructures with the diameter of 1 \u00b5m can form the core-shell p-n+ configuration (Fig. 4b). For nanostructure system, the n+ doping layer could fulfill the whole nanostructure region as well as the part of contiguous substrate (red section in Fig. 4a), resulting in an unfavorable energy band bending in the textured Si as shown in Fig. 4A-A and thus facilitating the carriers\u2019 recombination including surface and Auger recombination. As to the situation of nanowire, the fully-doped profile can equivalent to a planar structure with deeper diffusion depth and an enlarged surface which is rich in defects. The total diffusion depth equal to the sum of nanowire height and the diffused depth beneath. It is well known that even for the planar structure, the \u03c4 eff and J 0 (saturation current density) will also be changed dramatically with the diffusion depth and concentration [25]. The \u03c4 eff has a reverse relation with the diffusion depth. Therefore, certainly, the \u03c4 eff of nanowire will largely depend on the height of nanowire. However, for the radial p-n junction of microwire, the diffusion layer can be well controlled in a thin layer along with the surface of structure. Due to the quite short distance in the radial direction and the all-around field configuration, the thin radial p-n junction can form a strong field. With the help of this strong electric field, holes will be prevented from the surface and the surface recombination of microstructure will be largely suppressed, as shown in Fig. 4B-B [26]. Meanwhile, because the photogenerated carriers mainly exist in the center of pencil structures (Fig. S2), the Auger recombination can also be well suppressed through keeping the center of pencil structure at a low doping level (p-Si). Therefore, micropillar with radial p-n junction can maintain good surface passivation (Fig. 1i) and less IQE loss (Fig. 2a) from Auger recombination even for the cases of A F/A proj > 5. Except for the discussion on Auger recombination rate at a specific wavelength of 400 nm, the J sc losses across the entire considered wavelengths (i.e., 300\u20131200 nm) under different doping temperatures were also collected by both simulation and experiments, as shown in Fig. 5(a and b). Because the surface recombination is no longer the main factor that is responsible for J sc loss, we neglect it in this simulation and only consider J sc loss caused by Auger recombination. Fig. 5a illustrated the J sc loss as a function of doping temperatures and the pitches of pencil arrays. For the four samples of planar silicon and 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 \u03bcm-pitch micropencil arrays, a similar tendency of increasing J sc loss with the doping temperatures was clearly observed. In addition, at the same doping temperature, the J sc loss become more pronounced with shrinking the feature size from infinite (planar), 2.4\u20130.6 \u00b5m. Region I and Region II were thus defined to represent the micropencil structures with all \u2018dead layer\u2019 (similar as Fig. 4a) and core-shell p-n+ junction (similar as Fig. 4b), respectively. The region definition is based on whether the \u2018dead layer\u2019 (N d > 1 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123) depth crosses over the diameter of micropencil or not. For example, the \u2018dead layer\u2019 depth of 850 \u00b0C doping temperature is about 0.35 \u00b5m, which exceeds the radius of 0.6 \u03bcm-pitch pencil (0.25 \u00b5m), so it belongs to Region I. From Fig. 5a, one can find that micropencil structures have different transformation temperatures from Region II to Region I depending on the different diameters. At the boundary between region I and region II, an abrupt change in J sc loss was identified, indicating the powerful effectiveness of the formation of radial p-n+ junction on suppression of the Auger recombination. To further verify the simulated results, the experimental J sc losses were presented in Fig. 5b. To remit the influences of recombination on the rear side, the experimental J sc losses shown here were calculated by integrating IQE spectrum weighted by photon flux density of AM 1.5 solar spectrum from 300 to 900 nm. The experimental results agreed well with the simulated values. The planar device exhibits minimum J sc loss of below 2 mA/cm2 even at a higher doping temperature of 875 \u00b0C. As the doping temperature dropped down to 850 \u00b0C, the J sc loss of 2.4 \u00b5m-pitch and 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropencils are only 0.5 and 2.1 mA/cm2, respectively. However, at the elevated doping temperature of 875 \u00b0C, J sc loss from 1.2 \u03bcm-pitch micropencils rapidly increased to more than 12 mA/cm2 due to the formation of all \u2018dead layer\u2019 in the structure (Region I). It is worth mentioning that even though the trends of experiments are similar to that of simulation, the changing temperature of J sc loss from experiments is slightly lower than that from the simulation. This variation may come from the neglect of surface recombination, the assumption of forming uniform p-n+ junction [27]. In fact, for reducing the influence of surface recombination from the surface defect, it is better to form a strong field passivation along with the whole surface of textures. In addition, in order to reduce the influence of Auger recombination, the thickness of the diffusion layer should be controlled as thin as possible. Therefore, the optimized diffusion layer should be uniformly distributed along with the surface of microwire structures. Although it shows a relative uniform doping with an indirect doping method (see details in Fig. S3), improvements in order to form a thin but homogeneous enough diffusion layer should be emphasized in future. According to above discussion, well-designed micropencil arrays can be a promising platform to render the formation of radial p-n+ junction with tunable junction depth. As shown in Fig. 6, silicon micropencil solar cells were therefore fabricated with varied doping temperatures. The schematic of the cells was shown in Fig. 6a. Limited by the immature fabricating techniques including large shaded area (~10%, about 4 mA/cm2 loss in J sc) and the high resistance of top metal contacts and poor aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF), the photovoltaic (PV) performances shown here are relatively unsatisfied. Nevertheless, the results showed in Fig. 6b and listed in Table 1 can still give great potential for high-efficiency silicon micropencil solar cells with radial junctions. Note that the J sc of micropencil arrays with 825 \u00b0C and 850 \u00b0C doping temperatures are both higher than 35 mA/cm2, while it rapidly drops down to 25.4 mA/cm2 for the 875 \u00b0C doping temperature, with a value even less than that of planar counterpart. This phenomenon is consistent with Fig. 5b, indicating the entrance from Region II to Region I (as indicated in Fig. 5a). As a result, our micropencil device achieved the best PCE of 15.3%, with a V oc of 582 mV, a FF of 74.4% and a superior J sc of 35.3 mA/cm2 at 850 \u00b0C. 3 Conclusion In summary, silicon microwire solar cells with radial p-n+ junctions were successfully fabricated, of which the surface and Auger recombination, as well as PV performance were systematically studied as a function of the structural parameters and junction depth. Different to the conventionally nanotextured b-Si, the surface passivation qualities of micropillar arrays with radial p-n+ junctions are nearly independent to the pillar height (i.e. the aspect ratio), and even comparable to the planar silicon (lifetimes > 200 \u03bcs). Further simulated and experimental studies showed that the Auger recombination on the microwire solar cells has a close correlation to the doping condition and the diameter of microstructures. The 2.4 \u03bcm-pitch micropencil arrays with a radial p-n+ junction formed at 850 \u00b0C can suppress the Auger recombination related J sc loss as low as 0.5 mA/cm2. As a result, we obtained a champion efficiency of 15.3% for the silicon micropencil solar cells, much higher than that of reference cells with fully-doped emitters (11.1%). Our findings show that the formation and control of radial junction on silicon microwire arrays can efficiently suppress both surface and Auger recombination, indicating a feasible way towards high-efficiency solar cells and solar-to-fuel devices. 4 Methods 4.1 Method of simulation In this simulation, the COMSOL Multiphysics software was employed to implement the photoelectric simulations, which gain the performances of devices by solving the Maxwell's and carrier transport equations. The periodic boundary conditions were utilized to ensure a perfect cell on the double sides for both optical and electrical modules. In the optical module, by coupling the spatial structure with the frequency domain, we can obtain a series of optical parameters including absorption response and electric field distribution as well as photogenerated carriers\u2019 distribution. Then, based on the carriers\u2019 generation in the optical module, the electrical processes including carriers\u2019 transport, recombination and collection can be well imitated and the stabilized distributions, which includes the carriers and recombination ratio can be well addressed. It is worth noting that we ignore the impact of heavy doping on optical absorption, which means the same optical performances under different doping concentrations as shown in Fig. 3b. Besides, the photoelectric parameters of silicon used in the simulation, including refractive index, electron and hole mobility, carrier lifetime, coefficients of carrier recombination, material bandgap, etc., can be found in previous publications [28\u201330]. 4.2 Fabrication of micropillar arrays Czochralski grown, 400-\u03bcm-thick, double-side polished p-type (100) Si wafers (2\u20134 \u03a9 cm) were utilized in the work. The micropillar arrays were fabricated via an anisotropic wet etching technique, as introduced elsewhere [31,32]. Monodispersed polystyrene (PS) microspheres with two different pitches (1.2 \u00b5m and 2.4 \u00b5m) were separately assembled on the Si substrate via Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method, followed by a reactive-ion etching (RIE) operation to reduce the diameter of microspheres [33,34]. A 1.5/5/10 nm-thick Ti/Ag/Au metal catalyst was deposited by electron beam evaporation on the side covered with the microspheres[ [35].] After the removal of the PS microspheres with sonication in chloroform, the samples were covered through a shallow mask [36]. Another Ti/Au (1.5/20 nm) films were deposited on the gap of mask. The samples were immersed in a composited solution (H2O2/HF/H2O/ktOH=1/5/10/10 by volume) at room temperature for different time to control the height. Then the micropillar arrays were rinsed with aqua regia to remove Au mesh. 4.3 Fabrication of micropencil arrays The micropencil arrays were made by a multiple-cycle chemical etching process [15]. The micropillar arrays were etched in a mixed solution of AgNO3 (0.0002 M), HF (2 M) and HNO3 (0.005 M) for 10\u201315 min. After every etching cycle, the samples were transferred into a 10 wt% HNO3 solution for 2 min to remove the residual Ag clusters followed with a rinse in DI water. 4.4 Fabrication of silicon solar cells The emitter layer was formed by the spin-on dopant (SOD) method. After the RCA cleaning (as developed at Radio Corporation of America), the phosphorus dopant source (P509, Filmtronics, Inc) was spin-coated on a dummy wafer, and then baked at 200 \u00b0C for 15\u201320 min. In order to tune the doping profiles, the diffusion temperature was varied from 800 \u00b0C to 950 \u00b0C for different batches. For each batch, a two-step diffusion process was conducted in a tube furnace under a mixed ambient atmosphere of O2 (375 sccm) and N2 (1125 sccm) for 30 min, followed with O2 (1500 sccm) for 10 min. The reason of adding the second step is to oxidize the phosphorus-rich layer (PRL), so as to easily remove it by the following HF treatment. Removing the PRL can help to improve the passivation quality of sequentially coated passivation layer. The textured Si samples were abutted the dummy wafer for conformal doping. The phosphorous silicate glass which remained after SOD diffusion was removed by 4 vol% HF solution. A thin SiO2 passivation layer was formed by thermal oxidation at 800 \u00b0C for 30 min. The thickness of SiO2 layer is in the range of 5\u201315 nm depending on the amount of doped phosphorus that was controlled by the diffusion temperature. Back metal contact was made by aluminum paste and alloying at 750 \u00b0C. For the front metal contact, the grid pattern was formed by photolithography and etched in buffered hydrogen fluoride corrosion solution [37]. A Cr/Pd/Ag contact grid was made by electron beam evaporation and metal lift-off operation. 4.5 Characterization The morphologies of the samples were conducted by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Ultra Plus). Effective carrier lifetime was analyzed by a microwave photoconductivity decay system (WCT-120, Sinton Consulting). The dopant concentration and junction depth were measured by electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV). The PV performance of solar cells was measured under a simulated AM 1.5 spectrum sunlight illumination and with a 0.5 cm2 effective illumination area through a measurement mask. The reflectance and IQE curves were measured by a quantum efficiency system (QEX10).

These will abate the cost values of b-Si since one has to adopt a comprise strategy of applying shallow nanotextures with antireflection and passivation layers.
