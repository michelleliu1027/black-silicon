Nanostructuring has been projected as an appropriate technique to make thin silicon an efficient absorber. Although nano-textured surfaces have shown an anti-reflective effect, their surface passivation properties are found to be generally worse compared to standard micro-textured surfaces. Here, a novel front surface design has been proposed and simulated to balance the photonic and electronic effects together. ZrO2 based texturing has been used along with SiC-based front surface passivation for the suppression of interface recombination and improvement of open-circuit voltage (VOC). The device under investigation shows record VOC of 662 mV in the sub-10 \u03bcm-thick rear contact silicon solar cell. The presence of ZrO2 and SiC significantly improves the optical as well as the electrical behavior of the device. The device exhibits external quantum efficiency (EQE) > 81% in the spectrum range of 320\u2013720 nm wavelength spectrum with a maximum of 95.6% at wavelength 560 nm. These improvements lead to 15.7% efficient rear contact silicon solar cell, in the sub-10 \u03bcm-thick regime. In second approach power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.6% has been achieved, by introducing the same front surface design to a 300 \u03bcm thick device. All the simulations have been done using calibrated software program in ATLAS device simulation. Graphical abstract Image 1 Keywords Absorption Recombination Solar cell Silicon carbide (SiC) ZrO2 1 Introduction Photovoltaic (PV) is a simple and elegant method of coupling the sun's energy. Solar cells are exceptional in that they directly convert the incident solar radiation into electricity, with no pollution and noise, making them robust, reliable and long lasting. Solar cells are attractive candidates for clean and renewable power [1]. Silicon (Si) is the most extensively used material for solar cell production due to its abundance, reliability, nontoxicity, and mature fabrication techniques. Further, solar cell technology is a function of efficiency, cost, and a lifetime of the cell. Hence, large-scale implementation is not economically feasible. To absorb the solar spectrum, the thickness of the planar cell is typically more than 100 \u03bcm [2]. This requirement results in higher cost. Also, in order to increase the collection of the generated carriers, the dimension of the device should be comparable to the carrier diffusion length. Thinner silicon solar cells with high efficiency are fruitful for cost-effective energy solution [3,4]. Further, to maximize solar cell efficiency, it is necessary to optimize both, the device electrical characteristics and the optical absorption of thin devices [5,6]. Nanostructuring has been projected as an appropriate method to make thin silicon an efficient absorber. However, these cells are not efficient due to Auger and surface recombination as the surface to volume ratio of the cells is large. However, recently, methods to minimize the surface recombination for nanostructured based \u223c300 \u03bcm thick devices have been presented which results in 20% and 22% efficient cells [7,8]. The PCE of nanostructured Si solar cell remains below 22.2% for thick devices [7,8] and below 11% for thin devices [9], except 13.7% and 15.7% reported in Refs. [9,10] for the 10 \u03bcm thick devices. In previous work, a 14.3% efficient ZrO2 textured rear contact solar cell has been proposed. The work shows efficient photon absorption in the sub-10-\u03bcm-thick device [11]. ZrO2 is a material of great technology due to its outstanding mechanical and electrical properties and high dielectric constant. Large band gap (Eg \u223c 6eV) and dielectric properties (\u025b \u223c 25) suggested its potential to replace SiO2 in the advance semiconductor device and optical applications [12]. Also, it has an excellent thermal stability. This work further extends the study of ZrO2 textured front surface based rear contact silicon solar cell having thin defect free SiC layer at the ZrO2/Si interface. The presence of thin SiC layer minimizes the reflectivity [13,14]. Previous work shows, embedding 3C-SiC nanoparticles significantly reduces the photo reflectivity in UV/visible spectrum region [15]. The SiC is an indirect (Eg = 2.2 eV) semiconductor with wide energy band gap, high thermal conductivity, large breakdown field, and high saturation velocity make this material an ideal choice for high temperature, high power, high voltage electron devices. Its high melting point, chemical inertness, high wear resistance, and extreme hardness, make it possible to fabricate sensors and actuators capable of performing in harsh environments [16]. The SiC film formation has been done for Si solar cell passivation. The film was deposited on silicon (100) and glass substrates by an RF magnetron co-sputtering system [17]. Recently, SiC passivated SiGe wafer based rear contact solar cells have been proposed for ultra-high efficiency in sub 10 \u03bcm thick devices; work shows improved optical absorption without the need of complex texturing [18,19]. Moreover, this work shows that the presence of SiC improves the photovoltaic parameters of ZrO2 based rear contact solar cell. The discussed device shows JSC and VOC of 29.3 mA cm\u22122, 662 mV respectively. This results, in 15.7% PCE in sub 10-\u03bcm thick solar cell, which is equivalent to the experimentally achieved record PCE of 15.7% using periodic nanostructure [10]. However, present work shows superior VOC, which shows that the surface recombination issue has truly been solved and SiC passivation based nanostructured silicon solar cell have real potential for industrial production. The rear contact silicon solar cell has been selected because it is a promising high-efficiency solar cell having both, junction and the electrodes at the back side of the device. Now, since the junction and contacts are on the back side, front surface can be designed for optimum optical performance [20]. 2 Device structure and simulation In this section, the calibrated software program is written in Silvaco ATLAS device simulator as per the results reported by (sangmoo jeong et al., 2013) for 10 \u03bcm thick rear contact solar cell with antireflection (AR) coating [9]. The dimensions and the doping density of the planar device were identical to the referenced cell and named as Device A as shown in Fig. 1 . The device geometry in the simulation was (50-\u03bcm-wide pitch, 46 \u03bcm-wide P+, and 30-\u03bcm-wide N+). The substrate was N-type, with doping density (3 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22123). P+ region was doped with boron (4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22123, depth of 300 nm). N+ region was doped with phosphorous (1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22123, depth of 100 nm). Further, in the presence of heavy doping, (>1018 cm\u22123), experimental work has shown that the PN product in silicon turns out to be doping dependent [21]. As the doping level rises, a decrease in the bandgap occurs, where the valence band raises by the approximately same amount as the conduction band is lowered. Discussed structure has heavily doped P and N regions, and so bandgap narrowing effects are enabled. These effects can be described by an analytic expression relating the variation in the bandgap, \u0394Eg to the doping concentration, N [22]. Furthermore, the solar cells are the carrier recombination affected devices. Therefore, Auger and Shockley- Read- Hall (SRH) recombination models are selected during the simulation. Phonon transitions occur in the presence of a trap or defect within the forbidden gap of the semiconductor [23,24]. Basic for the SRH model are the assumptions of one trap level in the forbidden band and drift-diffusion assumption for the transport of electrons and holes, and the assumption that the dynamics of the trapped carrier is quasi-stationary [25]. Auger recombination occurs through a three particle transition whereby a mobile carrier is either captured or emitted. The underlying physics of such processes is unclear, and normally a more qualitative understanding is sufficient [26]. The auger coefficients, C p = 9.9 \u00d7 10\u221232 cm6 s\u22121 and C n = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221231 cm6 s\u22121 have been used for P-type and N-type silicon, respectively, at 300 K temperature [27]. The concentration dependent mobility and field dependent mobility models have also been selected during simulation. The consistent set of models and parameters for the simulation of Si solar cell have been used as suggested in already published article [28]. To obtain the current density (J)- voltage (V) curve under illumination, the standard AM1.5 solar spectrum has been used. Also, as the contact interface between metal and semiconductor is highly doped both for the P+ and N+ region i.e. \u223c1020 cm\u22123, therefore, the ohmic contacts are used in this work. This has been done to avoid Schottky barriers, and thus unnecessarily higher computation time. Result reveals, the software program, is well calibrated within the acceptable range shown in Table 1 . 3 Results The result section is divided into two parts, first, designing a ZrO2 textured and thin SiC-based ZrO2 textured 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm thick N-type silicon wafer for optimal spectrum response and second, the designed ZrO2 pattern with and without SiC has been introduced to Device A, by removing anti-reflective coating (ARC) layer. ZrO2 textured 10 \u03bcm thick rear contact silicon solar cell is called as Device B, and ZrO2 textured device with SiC layer at the ZrO2/N-Si interface is termed as Device C. 3.1 Spectrum response of ZrO2 textured SiC-based silicon wafer In this section, a 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm thick N-type Si wafer without ARC, with ARC, textured ZrO2 and textured ZrO2 having SiC (20 nm) layer at ZrO2/N-Si interface have been designed and simulated to obtain the spectrum response. The entire front surface is covered with repeated ZrO2 facet structures and optimized height, 175 nm, and width, 250 nm is used for texturing. The smaller and larger width size than 250 nm will show lower optical coupling and lower conversion efficiency, as suggested in Ref. [29]. In the real cell, the nanopatterns can be fabricated via inexpensive and scalable imprinting technique. The complex refractive index of various materials has been obtained from Sopra database [30] and presented in Fig. 2 (a\u2013b). Fig. 2a shows, as wavelength changes from 300 to 1200 nm, the reflective index, n of ZrO2 changes from 2.45 to 2.17. the n values of ZrO2 are close to the n values of nitride, which is usually used as AR coating for silicon solar cell [31\u201333]. Further, the spectral response of Si wafers is presented in Fig. 3 (a\u2013b). Result shows, planar silicon wafer without coating is highly reflective i.e. absorption is small in the range of 300\u20131000 nm wavelength spectrum. Also, ARC coating based Si wafer shows >96% absorption in the spectrum range of 500\u2013625 nm wavelength. Lower and higher wavelength response is however not remarkable. The ZrO2 textured wafer shows improved optical behavior compared to ARC coating based wafer due to anti-reflection and light scattering. This concludes that higher absorption is achieved in the ZrO2 textured wafer, which further results in higher available photocurrent shown in Fig. 3b. Results also indicate that throughout the spectrum range (300\u20131000 nm), ZrO2 textured wafer shows enhanced absorption as compared to ARC coated wafer. At a wavelength equivalent to 300 nm, 77% absorption is achieved in the silicon wafer. Also, photon absorption >82% has been achieved in the spectrum range of 325\u2013850 nm wavelength with a maximum of 98.2%. This shows spectrum response has been improved due to ZrO2 textured front surface. Further, optical behavior of SiC-based ZrO2 textured wafer has also been obtained. The efficiency of a solar cell is directly related to the amount of light entering the cell. Antireflection coating is used to reduce the reflection of the useful light while not absorbing it. Our previous work shows that the photon coupling in underlying substrate is higher for 20 nm thick SiC-based device. Whereas, increasing the SiC thickness results in parasitic absorbance in SiC, and lower photon coupling in underlying substrate. Since, absorbance directly depends on the thickness of the material. This further results in lower short circuit current density and power conversion efficiency [18]. Therefore, the thickness of SiC used in the simulation is only 20 nm whose absorption is negligible hence, optical coupling in underlying silicon is higher. Also, the optical properties i.e. refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) required for an AR coating depends on the refractive index of the underlying substrate, encapsulated cover, and the operating wavelengths. The material having low absorption of useful light is needed, to reduce the absorption of useful light in ARC. Therefore, low k values are required, k value of 0.01 corresponds to less than 1% absorption, since \u03b1 = 4\u043fk/\u03bb. Fig. 2a and b shows that SiC has n between 2.9 and 2.5 in the spectrum range of 300\u20131200 nm and k of less than 0.01 for the wavelengths greater than 430 nm. Also, according to the patented work of Allen et al. [34] SiC film having n between 2.7 and 2.3 and k of less than 0.01 at a wavelength of 630 nm is a good candidate for antireflective coating for solar cells. This confirms that presence of SiC will not degrade the optical behaviors of ZrO2 based wafer. Furthermore, a contour plot of photons absorption rate in the wafers is also shown in Fig. 4(a\u2013d). Higher photon coupling has been observed in both ZrO2 based and SiC- based ZrO2 textured wafer. This results in higher absorption rate as well as higher absorption depth compared to ARC based device, as shown in Fig. 4c and d and Fig. 4g and h. 3.2 Rear-contact solar cell with ZrO2 textured front surface Spectral results as discussed shows that the optical performance of Si wafer is significantly improved in the case of ZrO2 textured front surface. Therefore, ARC coating of Device A is replaced with ZrO2 textured front surface with rest of the device parameters being the same. In this section, the performance of two ZrO2 textured solar cells has been obtained, one with 20 nm thick SiC layer at the interface (Device B) and another without SiC layer at the interface (Device C). Also, the results of the devices are compared with planar rear contact device as shown in Fig. 1. Here, Device B and Device C have been simulated with the help of calibrated program written for device A. Results of previous section shows, an amalgamation of thin SiC layer does not degrade the optical behavior of the wafer. Hence, both the devices i.e. device B and device C shows significant improvement in device photovoltaic parameters: in terms of short circuit current density (JSC), VOC, fill factor (FF), and PCE compared to device A. Fig. 5 (a\u2013f), shows the contour plot of recombination rate in Device A, Device B, and Device C, respectively. The device architecture is such that the holes generated at point 1, in Fig. 1 need to travel shorter to arrive at N \u2014 P+ interface, whereas the holes generated at point 2, needs to travel a greater lateral distance. Under short-circuit condition, a space charge region is formed around the junction having an associated electric field that collects the generated electron-hole pairs, and the collection is complete near P+ region. However, outside the P+ region, the substrate is neutral, and the collection will be by diffusion of electrons and holes towards the field region where they will be collected and separated. The electrons and holes generated in a region greater than the diffusion length will never reach the junction, and the recombination process will balance out. This results in higher recombination rate in region II compared to the region I, shown in Fig. 5. Further, Fig. 5c and f shows that significant improvement in surface recombination has been obtained in Device C compared to Device A and Device B. The analysis reveals that recombination rate near the SiC/N-Si interface is small compared to the bulk region (N-Si) of the device. The presence of SiC creates an electric field at the interface and is directed from SiC to Si, rendering it energetically unfavorable for holes transport to SiC/N-Si interface, resulting in a low concentration of holes at the passivating interface [18,35]. Thus, sinking the holes concentration at the interface will produce higher concentration difference between electrons and holes, and results in lower surface recombination rate [36]. Results conclude that presence of ZrO2 textured front surface increases the optical response and presence of SiC at the ZrO2/N-Si interface minimizes the surface recombination. Therefore, the dual advantage has been obtained with the help of SiC and ZrO2. Further, the J-V curve is presented in Fig. 6 , for Device A, Device B, and Device C, respectively. Also, the photovoltaic parameters are concluded in Table 1. The J-V curve of Device A is identical to the J-V curve of the planar 10-\u03bcm-thick solar cell with anti-reflection (AR) layer, presented by (sangmoo jeong et al., 2013) [9]. This also validates the calibration of the software program. Moreover, lower recombination and higher Photogeneration lead to improved JSC and VOC in Device B and Device C compared to Device A. The JSC, VOC of 28.6 mA cm\u22122, 623 mV, and 29.3 mA cm\u22122, 662 mV have been obtained in Device B and Device C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. Hence, 32% higher JSC and 7% higher VOC has been obtained in Device C compared to Device A. Also, the VOC of the Device C is 6% higher compared to Device B which shows that the presence of SiC in ZrO2 textured rear contact device significantly boost the photovoltaic performance of the device by suppressing the surface recombination. The overall PCE of the Device C is 42% and 11% higher compared to Device A and Device B respectively. Moreover, the impact of minority carrier lifetime has been studied to obtain the effect of material quality on photovoltaic parameters, and the results are presented in Fig. 7 (a\u2013d). The discussed device is thin compared to conventional silicon solar cells and hence, the device can be fabricated with inexpensive, less pure material. Also, the charge carriers in discussed device need to diffuse shorter length whereas, in conventional rear contact device, a long carrier lifetime is required to collect the carrier because the thickness is usually >150 \u03bcm. This results in, increased module cost since high-purity material is required. Results show that the impact of minority carrier lifetime is negligible on all the three devices. However, the overall photovoltaic parameters of the Device C are superior compared to Device A and Device B. At \u03c4 equivalent to 10\u22122 s, the PCE of 11.3%, 14.7%, and 16.5% have been obtained in Device A, Device B, and Device C respectively, whereas, for \u03c4 equivalent to 10\u22125 s, the values are 11.0%, 14.4%, and 15.7%, respectively. This shows only 4% change in PCE is observed for Device C, as carrier lifetime changes from 10\u22122 s to 10\u22125 s. All the photovoltaic parameters of Device C are good compared to Device A and Device B as shown in Fig. 7 (a\u2013d). 3.3 SiC- based ZrO2 textured 300 \u03bcm thick rear contact solar cell The results of the previous section show that the performance of silicon solar cell is improved with the help of SiC- based ZrO2 texturing, however, optical absorption falls to lower values in the wavelength range of 900\u2013100 nm, whereas simulated spectrum goes up to 1200 nm. The absorption coefficient of silicon is small at higher wavelength [37,38] and hence to increase the absorption up to 1200 nm, thicker silicon is required. Therefore, a 300 \u03bcm thick SiC-based ZrO2 textured rear contact solar cell has also been designed and its optical, as well as electrical parameters, are compared with 10 \u03bcm thick device as discussed in previous sections. Fig. 8 show the optical behavior of the devices i.e. 10 \u03bcm and 300 \u03bcm thick devices, respectively. The available photocurrent is shown in Fig. 8a along with source photocurrent of the spectrum. Improved available photocurrent has also been obtained in 300 \u03bcm thick device in higher wavelength regime. The EQEs of the two devices have also been obtained and presented in Fig. 8b. Results show, significant improvement in the higher wavelength region. The EQE fall to lower values at higher wavelength compared to 10-\u03bcm thick device, as shown in Fig. 8b. Further, J-V curve of the devices is shown in Fig. 9 . Results indicate that improved optical response of 300 \u03bcm thick device leads to significant improvement in JSC. The minority carrier lifetime of 1 ms has been selected for the thicker device to prevent the bulk recombination of generated carriers. The JSC (39.40 mA cm\u22122), VOC (687 mV), FF (80%), and PCE (21.6%) have been obtained. In experimental work, modulated surface textured (MST) based rear contact device shows JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE values of 40.5 mA cm\u22122, 635 mV, 77%, and 19.8%, respectively [7]. This shows that simulated results are in good agreement with experimental results. The VOC value of the experimental device is lower compared to the device under investigation. This concludes that the optimum surface passivation has been achieved in this work compared to experimental results due to the presence of SiC. This shows that the amalgamation of SiC in experimental devices can significantly suppress the carrier recombination at the interface and lead to higher open circuit voltage. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in Table 2 along with already available experimental results. 4 Conclusions This work presents an efficient optical absorption and improved surface passivation in sub-10 \u03bcm-thick Si solar cell device. ZrO2 and SiC based front surface are designed for the silicon wafer, and spectrum response is obtained. The wafer shows absorption (87%) at short wavelengths (300 nm). Results show that throughout the wavelength spectrum 300\u20131000 nm i.e. (UV\u2013Visible\u2013Infrared), ZrO2 textured wafer having thin SiC at the interface (ZrO2/N-Si) shows significant improvement in optical absorption. Hence, ZrO2 textured SiC-based rear contact solar cell has been designed and simulated to achieve lower interface recombination and improved open-circuit voltage (VOC). This results in enhanced photovoltaic parameters compared to the conventional rear contact solar cell with AR coating. The JSC and VOC of 29.3 mA cm\u22122, 661 mV have been obtained. This results in 15.7% PCE in the sub-10 \u03bcm-thick rear contact silicon solar cell. Further, a 21.6% efficient 300 \u03bcm thick device has also been designed and simulated. Results show that if fabricated experimentally it can prove to be a cost-effective solution for energy efficient applications.

Although nano-textured surfaces have shown an anti-reflective effect, their surface passivation properties are found to be generally worse compared to standard micro-textured surfaces. Here, a novel front surface design has been proposed and simulated to balance the photonic and electronic effects together. ZrO2 based texturing has been used along with SiC-based front surface passivation for the suppression of interface recombination and improvement of open-circuit voltage (VOC). The device under investigation shows record VOC of 662 mV in the sub-10 \u03bcm-thick rear contact silicon solar cell. The presence of ZrO2 and SiC significantly improves the optical as well as the electrical behavior of the device. The device exhibits external quantum efficiency (EQE) > 81% in the spectrum range of 320\u2013720 nm wavelength spectrum with a maximum of 95.6% at wavelength 560 nm. These improvements lead to 15.7% efficient rear contact silicon solar cell, in the sub-10 \u03bcm-thick regime.
