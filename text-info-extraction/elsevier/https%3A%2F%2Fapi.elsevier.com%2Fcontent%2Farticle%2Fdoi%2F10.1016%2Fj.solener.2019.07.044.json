College of Energy Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations Soochow University No. 688, Moye Road Suzhou Jiangsu 215006 China In this work, black multi-crystal silicon (Mc-Si) solar cells with bowl-like nanotextured surfaces were successfully fabricated by a metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) method. Defect removal etching processes of various durations were used to form bowl-like nanostructures of three sizes on the wafer surface. Overall, a low depth and large diameter of bowl-like structure in nanotextured surfaces is demonstrated to be helpful in reducing surface recombination and improving the cell and module performance. The average cell module power of the bowl-like nanotextured surfaces with an average bowl diameter 680\u202fnm is clearly higher by 1.51\u202fW, 1.46\u202fW, and 1.26\u202fW than for nanotextured surfaces with bowl diameter 460\u202fnm in the 18.8%, 18.9%, and 19.0% efficiency bins. A maximum cell efficiency of 19.17% and module power of 279.74\u202fW were obtained using our MACE process in an industrial mass production line. The techniques presented in this paper can be used for the mass production of diamond wire sawing Mc-Si solar cells and meet the requirements of high efficiency and low cost in the photovoltaic industry. Keywords Black silicon Nanotextured surface Efficiency Module power 1 Introduction Diamond wire sawing (DWS) of silicon bricks is a competitive alternative to the more established multi-wire SiC slurry sawing (SS) process. DWS has several noticeable advantages over the SS process: higher productivity, lower material waste, a higher precision when cutting thin wafers, and less mechanical surface damages (Yue et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2016). However, multi-crystal silicon (Mc-Si) wafers obtained by DWS present different saw damage levels from wafers obtained by SS, which makes standard HF/HNO3 etching less suitable to achieve the desired surface textures (Niu et al., 2016). Finding new, fast approaches to obtain a uniform texture for DWS wafers is a priority for extending DWS technique and reducing production cost in the photovoltaic (PV) industry. Metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) performed on black silicon (BS) is of great interest to fabricate finely nanostructures on DWS Mc-Si wafers because of its simplicity and low cost (Cao et al., 2015; Kumagai, 2015; Yue et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2014). The excellent light absorbance of BS promises significant potential improvement in silicon solar cell efficiency, but the enlarged and defective surface obtained by nanostructuring can increase the specific surface area and Auger recombination rate of photo-generated carriers (Jiang et al., 2017; Oh et al., 2012). Furthermore, many studies have investigated different surface morphology of BS and showed NaOH or HF/HNO3 defect removal etching (DRE) process used in MACE method is helpful in improving cell performance by balancing the optical performance and electrical losses. (Toor et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2014; Yue et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2017). Su et al. (2018) reported an efficiency of 19.07% by optimizing the DRE processes in an HNO3/HF/H2O2/H2O solution by MACE method. To obtain a higher efficiency and to enable the mass production of BS solar cells, the DRE process must be optimized to obtain a suitable nanostructure that can achieve both good light absorbance and a high cell efficiency. More importantly, when solar cells are transferred into a module in practical situations, the power is less than the theoretical power due to the cell to module loss (CTM) that can be defined as the ratio of the module power to the cell power multiplied by the number of cells integrated in the module (Dasari et al., 2013; Hanifi et al., 2016; Saw et al., 2017). It is also necessary to confirm whether the cell textures of the BS impact the module power and the CTM. A few studies (Schneider et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2017; Haedrich et al., 2018) have investigated the relationship between the surface morphology of solar cells and module performance, but this research was still at the laboratory scale rather than at the industry scale. Therefore, more research on how the BS nanostructure influences the cell efficiency and the mass-produced module performance is needed. In this work, we investigated how the BS nanostructure influences the cell efficiency and module power by fabricating three kinds of bowl-like nanotextured surfaces using the MACE method. A DRE process in a HF/HNO3/H2O solution with various reaction times followed by a post-treatment in a NH3\u00b7H2O/H2O2/KOH/H2O solution was used to modify the nanostructures. Moreover, the morphology, surface reflectance, and solar cell performance were systematically determined. To determine the mass-produced module performance, two types of cells with good performance were assembled into PV modules, Thereafter, the module power and CTM based on the produced cells and modules power data for the different nanostructures were evaluated. 2 Experimental An overview of the complete process for the solar cell and module productions is given in Fig. 1 . P-type Mc-Si wafers (156\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f156\u202fmm, 190\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202f\u00b5m thick, specific resistance: 1\u20133\u202f\u03a9\u00b7cm) from JinkoSolar was used in this work. Various nanotextured surfaces were produced using the MACE method. First, the Si wafers were immersed in a KOH/H2O solution to remove saw damages and obtain a microtextured surface. Then, silver nanoparticles were deposited on the surface by dipping the wafers in a HF/AgNO3/H2O solution. The coated wafers were subsequently etched in a HF/H2O2/H2O solution after which the Si wafers were immersed in a NH3\u00b7H2O/H2O2/H2O solution to remove excessive silver nanoparticles. Next, the Si wafers were immersed in a HF/HNO3/H2O solution to yield a nanotextured surface. After this, the Si wafers were immersed in a NH3\u00b7H2O/H2O2/KOH/H2O solution to remove the silver nanoparticles and as a post-treatment for the nanostructures. In the next step, the wafers were cleaned in a HF/HCl/H2O solution at room temperature. Finally, the wafers were rinsed with deionized (DI) water and blown dry with clean dry air (CDA). Between each step, cleaning was performed using DI water for 60\u202fs at room temperature. After controlling the parameters for each step, three kinds of nanotextured surfaces with reflectivities of 16\u201317%, 18\u201319%, and 20\u201321% were fabricated and labeled as A, B, and C, respectively. After the texturing process, n-type emitters with sheet resistances from 80 to 90\u202f\u03a9/sq were formed by phosphorus diffusion using a liquid POCl3 source. Subsequently, the phosphor silicon glass (PSG) was removed and SiNx films were deposited as antireflection coatings on the n-type emitter surface by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Finally, a front side silver electrode (5 0.8\u202fmm busbars and 106 40\u202f\u03bcm fingers) and aluminum back surface field were screen-printed to provide an electrical contact and then co-fired in a belt furnace for metallization. After fabrication, B and C cell samples with same efficiencies were sorted and arrayed into modules using conventional module fabrication techniques. The modules consisted of 60 solar cells connected in series with an automatic contact soldering and lamination process. The ribbons were made of 180\u202f\u00b5m copper strips surrounded by 50\u202f\u00b5m of solder coating and the ribbon-attached cells were sandwiched by 0.45\u202fmm of ethylene vinyl acetate, 3.2\u202fmm of low-iron glass with anti-reflective coating, and 0.395\u202fmm of a white back sheet to protect the cells from mechanical loading and humidity. The final module dimensions were 1640\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f992\u202fmm. The cells and modules were characterized using several techniques. The morphologies and structures of the samples were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi-S-4800) and the surface reflectances were measured by reflectometry (Raditech D8-4). Surface sheet resistances and doping concentrations were measured by an automatic four-point probe sheet resistance tester (4D 280SI) and an electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) profile tester (WEP, CVP21), respectively. The effective carrier lifetime after passivation of both faces by SiNx was measured using a Siton WT-120 system. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the cells were measured by test equipment (H.a.L.m GmbH, 3600) and the module power was determined using a test system (Spire Solar 4600L) under standard conditions at a temperature of 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C and an irradiance of 1000\u202fW/m2 with an air mass of 1.5 (AM 1.5), respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the cells were tested by PV measurements on a QEX7 system (PV Measurements, Inc.). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Reflectivity and morphology The MACE method discussed in this paper contains four main steps: silver nanoparticles deposition, nanopores formation, nanopores enlargement and post-treatment modification. Figs. 2 and 3 show the top and cross-sectional SEM images of the samples at different processing steps as well as the reflectivity curves of the BS wafers corresponding to each main step. The solar averaged reflectance Ra is calculated by averaging the reflectance over the spectrum at an AM of 1.5 in the wavelength range from 300 to 1100\u202fnm (Huang et al., 2015): (1) Ra = \u222b 300 1100 R ( \u03bb ) N ( \u03bb ) d \u03bb \u222b 300 1100 N ( \u03bb ) d \u03bb where R \u03bb and N ( \u03bb ) are the measured reflectance and solar photon spectral distribution at AM 1.5, respectively. In this study, the weighted average reflectivity was calculated over the spectrum under AM 1.5 in the wavelength range from 350 to 1050\u202fnm. As shown in Figs. 2(a) and 3, silver nanoparticles were deposited on the microtextured surface from the HF/AgNO3/H2O solution after removing saw damages with the KOH/H2O solution; a reflectivity of 31.68% was obtained in this step. Fig. 2(b) shows that nanopores formed when the sample was immersed in the HF/H2O2/H2O solution. In this step, hydrogen reduction is catalyzed by the silver metal and to compensate for the increased electron consumption, an oxidation reaction occurs where the silver metal adheres to the silicon surface and forms a pit on the silicon wafer surface\u00b7H2O2 promotes the oxidation reaction and HF is used to remove the oxidation layer (Kumagai, 2015). This metal-catalyzed reaction resulted in a reduction in the surface reflectance and a reflectivity of 7.15% was obtained, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 2(c) shows that the nanopores were etched and enlarged using a DRE process in the HF/HNO3/H2O solution. In this step, the reflectance was increased to 13.42% (Fig. 3) due to morphological changes in the nanotextured surface. However, the nano-porous silicon around the edge of the bowl-like structure was not removed. After the post-treatment in the NH3\u00b7H2O/H2O2/KOH/H2O solution, the nanoporous silicon was removed and the nanotextured surface became smoother with a reflectivity of 19.66%, as shown in Figs. 2(d) and 3. Different sizes of the nanotextured bowl-like surface could be obtained by adjusting the reaction time and the temperature in each step. In this study, only the duration of the DRE process step in the HF/HNO3/H2O solution was adjusted to ensure that all other reaction conditions were the same and to minimize the variability between samples. Typical reaction times of 110, 130, and 150\u202fs in the HF/HNO3/H2O solution produced nanotextured surfaces with different sizes and different average reflectivities. Figs. 4 and 5 show the top and cross-sectional SEM images for different reaction times in the DRE process and the distribution map of the bowl diameter in the nanotextured surfaces. After different etching times in the HF/HNO3/H2O solution, the size of the bowl-like nanopore in nanotextured surfaces increased while their density decreased. The average diameter of the bowl varied between 330\u202fnm, 460\u202fnm, and 680\u202fnm for samples A, B and C, respectively, and for depth of the bowl between approximatively 300\u202fnm (samples A), 250\u202fnm (samples B), and 200\u202fnm (samples C), respectively. Fig. 6 shows reflectivity curves of samples A, B, and C between 350 and 1050\u202fnm. The average reflectivity of samples A, B, and C and its variation range increased with etching time and were measured to be 16.5% (range: 16\u201317%), 18.5% (range: 18\u201319%), and 20.5% (range: 20\u201321%), respectively. For nanotextures smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, the surface of the silicon appears homogenous whose refractive index (n) gradually changed from the refractive index of air (n\u202f=\u202f1) to that of bulk silicon (n\u202f=\u202f3.8) as the light travels through it (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010; Noor et al., 2019). The decrease in the depth of the bowl in nanotextured surfaces led to a change in the gradient index, as a result of which light absorption decreased and the reflectivity increased. Moreover, when the diameter of the bowl-like structure in nanotextured surfaces increased and the density decreased, both the different reflection times and the number of paths could result in decreased light absorbance and increased reflectivity. 3.2 Cell doping During fabrication, the cells had been doped using a diffusion process with POCl3 and Fig. 7 and Table 1 show the doping concentration curves and the main characteristics for samples. When the size of the bowl-like structure increased, the maximum doping concentration near a thickness of 25\u202fnm decreased and the depth of the p\u2013n junction increased as well. This is because the larger surface area of the BS wafer with smaller nanostructures resulted in phosphorus easily gathering at the surface, which led to a higher doping concentration at the surface. For phosphorus doping concentrations in silicon higher than 1018 atoms/cm3, Auger recombination will cause shorter lifetimes of carriers and higher surface recombination velocities in the emitter. These recombination processes result in a dead layer near the surface. Oh et al. (2012) showed that the nanostructures worsens the Auger and surface recombination channels by altering the doping profile and increasing the surface area, respectively. As sample A was made using the shortest reaction time in the DRE process, it had the smallest bowl-like nanopores on the surface (Fig. 4), therefore, the dead layer is the thickest and the doping concentration is the highest (1.67\u202f\u00d7\u202f1020 atoms/cm3) in A (Fig. 7 and Table 1), which is expected as the thick dead layer and high doping concentration indicate stronger Auger recombination processes in A than in the two other group samples. 3.3 Cell performance As the doping profiling revealed differences in surface recombination and passivation between the different types of samples, surface recombination was an important feature of the cell performance. Surface recombination is generally represented by the effective carrier lifetime of minority carriers \u03c4 eff , which can be expressed as (Oh et al., 2012): (2) 1 \u03c4 eff = 1 \u03c4 bulk + ( S eff F + S eff B ) d where \u03c4 bulk , S eff F , S eff B and d are the bulk lifetime, the surface recombination velocities (SRV) at the front and the back surfaces, respectively, and the wafer thickness. In our experiments, \u03c4 bulk and d were almost the same for every wafer. Therefore, the SRV at the front side can be characterized by \u03c4 eff . Table 2 shows the reflectance and effective carrier lifetime for each group of samples. During the PECVD process, a higher density and a higher depth of the bowl-like nanostructures resulted in incomplete coverage of the SiNx layer on the silicon surface, which led to poor passivation. Therefore, the effective carrier lifetime increased while the reflectivity after passivation by SiNx increased. Furthermore, Table 3 shows the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current (Isc), the contact resistance (Rs), the fill-factor (FF), and the efficiency (Eff) for each group of samples measured under AM 1.5 at 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C. The samples C had the best performance with an average Eff of 18.95% (maximum: 19.17%). We found that the average Voc of the samples C was enhanced by 2.25\u202fmV and 1.29\u202fmV compared to samples A and samples B, respectively. The average Isc value of 9.042 A of samples C was only slightly lower compared to samples A (9.053 A) and samples B (9.050 A). There are two main reasons for this behavior. On one hand, the nanopore surface area increased, which resulted in higher surface recombination and a lower Voc for the solar cell in samples A and B compared to samples C (Toor et al., 2015). The surface recombination is reduced by larger bowl-like structure sizes with a reflectivity of 20\u201321%, which increases the Voc. On the other hand, the average reflectivity of samples C was higher than samples A and B, which reduced light absorption and was the main reason for the decrease in Isc. However, the Rs value for samples C was the lowest, which was due to the larger (wider and more open) bowl-like structure sizes that increased the direct connection between the silver paste and the emitter region and provided an excellent filling for the silver electrode. This increased the carriers tunneling transport probability and the front silver electrode collected more light-induced carriers through a tunneling mechanism which led to the increase in Isc (Dou et al., 2014). This increased Isc partially compensated the current reduction due to the increase in reflectivity. The same results were obtained by Yang et al. (2017) for inverted pyramid structures on BS solar cells. The plot in Fig. 8 shows the dependence of reflectivity, EQE and IQE on the wavelength of incident light for each group of samples. The EQE and IQE of samples C was much higher than samples A and samples B between 300 and 1100\u202fnm, which strongly suggest that the surface with higher reflectivity led to better performing solar cells. The IQE below 700\u202fnm was improved greatly when the etching time increased, which indicated that the nanostructures had a great impact on surface recombination. Surface defects always cause IQE deterioration due to carrier recombination (Jiang et al., 2017). For samples A with a reflectivity of 16\u201317%, the thicker dead layer with heavy phosphorus doping as well as the higher density and depth of the bowl-like structure caused high Auger recombination. Moreover, incomplete coverage of the SiNx layer on the higher density and deeper depth of the nanostructured surface resulted in a degraded passivation performance. When the reflectivity of the samples increased, the maximum doping concentration of phosphorus, the thickness of the dead layer, the distribution density of the bowl-like nanopores, and the bowl-like nanopore depth grade decreased so that the Auger recombination decreased, which led to lower EQE and IQE losses. 3.4 Module performance After the performance of the cells had been evaluated, they were assembled into modules and the module performance was evaluated. The cell performance for each group corresponding to each module group is given in Table 4 . Table 5 and Fig. 9 show the characteristic maximum power of the module (Pmpp), Voc, Isc, FF, and the module power distribution for each group of sample modules measured under AM 1.5 at 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C. The CTM was also calculated from the Pmpp data for the cells and the modules and listed in Table 5. The module power varies significantly between each group even when the cells used to make the module were from the same efficiency bin with the same average efficiency. The results show that the average Pmpp of samples C was significantly higher by 1.51\u202fW, 1.46\u202fW, and 1.26\u202fW than samples B in the 18.8%, 18.9%, and 19.0% efficiency bins, respectively. Furthermore, the relative CTM ratio of samples C was improved by 0.54%, 0.53%, and 0.45% in the 18.8%, 18.9%, and 19.0% efficiency bins, respectively, than for nanotextured surfaces with a reflectivity of 18\u201319%. An average Pmpp of 278.50\u202fW with a maximum value of 279.74\u202fW was obtained using a 19.0% efficiency bin. The BS solar cell module performance is the sum of the individual solar cell contributions. The relative gain in Voc and FF due to the nanotexturing in the individual cells was also observed as a relative gain in the Voc and FF values of the modules, as shown in Table 5. The power of module samples C performed better than samples B in each bin due to a strong light coupling gain. This behavior is explained by photon recycling effects during embedding, which helps cells with an initially high reflectance loss to couple more light into the cell after embedding, whereas cells with an initially low reflectance loss in air do not show such a coupling gain (Haedrich et al., 2018). The increase in Voc and in FF are the main reasons that led to the increase in power, even for the same average efficiency. 4 Conclusions BS solar cells with three kinds of bowl-like nanotextured surfaces were fabricated by the MACE method. A DRE process in the HF/HNO3/H2O solution with different etching durations followed by a post-treatment in the NH3\u00b7H2O/H2O2/KOH/H2O solution was used to modify the nanostructures. It was found that a bowl-like nanotextured surface with a low depth and density was helpful in reducing surface recombination and improving the cell and module performance. Using our MACE process on an industrial mass production line, we obtained the highest cell efficiency (19.17%) and module power (279.74\u202fW) reported in the literature to date. Furthermore, even when modules were fabricated from solar cells from the same average efficiency bin, the average power of the modules and the relative loss with a nanotextured surface with an average bowl diameter 680\u202fnm was higher by about 1.3\u202fW and 0.5% than a nanotextured surface with an average bowl diameter 460\u202fnm. This result proves that proper texturing has a great influence on the cell performance and the module power. The MACE process showed in this paper can be used for the mass production of DWS Mc-Si solar cells and meet the high efficiency and low cost requirements in the PV industry.

Defect removal etching processes of various durations were used to form bowl-like nanostructures of three sizes on the wafer surface. Overall, a low depth and large diameter of bowl-like structure in nanotextured surfaces is demonstrated to be helpful in reducing surface recombination and improving the cell and module performance. The average cell module power of the bowl-like nanotextured surfaces with an average bowl diameter 680\u202fnm is clearly higher by 1.51\u202fW, 1.46\u202fW, and 1.26\u202fW than for nanotextured surfaces with bowl diameter 460\u202fnm in the 18.8%, 18.9%, and 19.0% efficiency bins. A maximum cell efficiency of 19.17% and module power of 279.74\u202fW were obtained using our MACE process in an industrial mass production line. The techniques presented in this paper can be used for the mass production of diamond wire sawing Mc-Si solar cells and meet the requirements of high efficiency and low cost in the photovoltaic industry.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2019-09-01", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X19307066", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Yang, Xiaoqin"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Wan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Choi, Jinho"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ta, Huy Q."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bai, Yupan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chen, Liangdao"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Mingming"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chen, Yuan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Guan, Zisheng"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rummeli, Mark H."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Lijun"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X19307066"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X19307066"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0038-092X(19)30706-6", "prism:volume": "189", "prism:publisher": "International Solar Energy Society.
