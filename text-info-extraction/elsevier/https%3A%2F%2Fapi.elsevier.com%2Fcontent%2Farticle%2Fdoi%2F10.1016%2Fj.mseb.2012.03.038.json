A study on the formation of Black Silicon on crystalline silicon surface using SF6/O2 and SF6/O2/CH4 based plasmas in a reactive ion etching (RIE) system is presented. The effect of the RF power, chamber pressure, process time, gas flow rates, and gas mixtures on the texture of silicon surface has been analyzed. Completely Black Silicon surfaces containing pyramid like structures have been obtained, using an optimized mask-free plasma process. Moreover, the Black Silicon surfaces have demonstrated average values of 1% and 4% for specular and diffuse reflectance respectively, feature that is suitable for the fabrication of low cost solar cells. Keywords Plasma Texturing Solar cells 1 Introduction At the present time, solar cells based on crystalline silicon technology (mono c-Si and multi c-Si) represent close to 90% of the total photovoltaic (PV) market [1], in spite of their higher cost when are compared with other type of technologies, as thin film solar cells based on different semiconductor materials [2\u20134]. The tendency is likely to continue in the next years, due to the relative high efficiency of c-Si solar cells [5], the continuous research on fabrication processes to improve the cell performance and the continuous efforts in the reduction of fabrication costs. In this aspect, hetero-junction solar cells fabricated on 200\u03bcm thick c-Si wafers have been reported with high efficiencies (>22%) and solar cells fabricated on 70\u03bcm thick c-Si wafers have been demonstrated [6]. Among different processes under constant research to increase the solar cells efficiency is the improvement of light trapping in the silicon surface in order to reduce the amount of light reflected [7\u201316]. Photolithography-free texturing processes have been used in order to produce pyramid-like structures in the silicon surface, providing reflectance values below of 12% [7,8]. Chemical solutions based on potassium hydroxide (KOH) [7\u201310], sodium hydroxide (NaOH) [11\u201313] and tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide ((CH3)4NOH) [14,15] have been employed. However, despite the low reflectance values due pyramid structures produced with wet processes, they have several drawbacks. These processes cannot be performed just in one wafer face (front surface) as is required, since texturing in the back surface reduces the quality of the dielectric rear surface passivation [17]. For large volume production in PV industry, high amounts of deionized water (DI) and chemicals represent an environmental and financial issue. Recently dry texturing processes have attracted much attention in order to produce highly textured surfaces [18\u201321]. For instance, SF6/O2 plasmas have been used for texturing c-Si wafers [20,21]. It is known that fluorine radicals easily etch silicon, and moreover the addition of oxygen to fluorine enhance the texturing process [22]. On SF6/O2 plasmas two opposite effects take place: an etching process due to fluorine radicals which are very efficient for etch silicon, and a re-deposition process due to residual SiO x F y film, which produce a masking effect [22]. Those micro-masks enhance the texturing process of the c-Si surface. It have been demonstrated the use of SF6/O2 plasmas for texturing c-Si employing a microwave (MW) powered antennas reactor [18,19], and a reactive ion etching (RIE) which is a standard process in the microelectronics industry [21]. However the sponge-like and needle-like structures reported respectively, are not suitable for reliable solar cell processes. Other type of plasmas based on SF6/Cl2 and SF6/CHF3 mixtures, or CF4 have been investigated [19,23,24], and other techniques to produce Black Silicon are under research, as laser texturing [25], plasma immersion ion implantation [26], formation of vertical silicon nanowires or nanograss arrays [27\u201331], and silicon nanotips arrays on c-Si surface with high aspect ratio using clusters of SiC [32], all techniques in order to reduce the light reflection. Thus, despite the efforts made so far on plasma texturing, none of the reported structures are similar those obtained by wet chemical texturing, which are suitable for a reliable passivation of the c-Si front surface, and still exists a constant research on the development of more reliable and standard dry texturing processes. In this work we present a study on the formation of pyramid-like structures, providing a Black Silicon surface, using the traditional mixture SF6/O2 and we proposed a new mixture SF6/O2/CH4, produced in a reactive ion etching (RIE) system. The effect of the RF plasma power, chamber pressure, process time, gas flow rates, and gas mixtures, on the texture of the silicon surface has been studied. Completely Black Silicon surfaces with average values of 1% and 4% for specular and diffuse reflectance respectively were obtained, using an optimized mask-free plasma process. 2 Experimental Texturing processes were carried out in a home-made reactive ion etching (RIE) reactor. For all experiments the substrates consisted of (100) monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers of 2.5cm\u00d74cm. Mixtures of gases containing SF6, O2, and CH4 in different compositions were used, with a ranging of gas pressure from 25 to 200mTorr, and RF power from 75 to 200W. A self-bias potential between the electrodes was measured. In most experiments, etching time was selected to be 20min, but in order to optimize the Black Silicon effect; time was increased to 30 and 45min. An atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanosurf EasyScan 2.3) was used to analyze the surface roughness of the textured c-Si wafers, while a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7000F Field Emission Analytical Scanning Electron Microscope) was used to characterize the surface morphology. Finally, a spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3 UV/VIS) was used for surface reflectance characterization in a 200\u2013900nm spectral range, and a spectrophotometer (Vector 22 Bruker) was employed to determine the surface composition by the IR spectra after texturing. 3 Results and discussion The DC self-bias voltage plays an important role in the Black Silicon formation; it is function of plasma parameters like RF power, pressure, and type and flow gas. This voltage controls the energy of ions arriving to the surface and it needs to be high in order to generate roughness on the surface. Fig. 1 shows the DC self-bias as a function of pressure (solid line) and RF power (dot line) for SF6/O2 and SF6/O2/CH4 gas mixtures for a constant flow rate of SF6 (30sscm), O2 (10sccm) and CH4 (4sccm). A typical behavior by ion-assisted etching is observed for both mixtures, DC bias increases as pressure decreases or RF power increases. The measured range of DC bias is between 10 and 300V. The highest values of DC bias are obtained when CH4 is incorporated to the SF6/O2 mixture; this effect can generate surface roughness. For these processes, Black Silicon surfaces are observed with roughness values around 30nm achieved by low DC self-bias voltages between 30 and 50V. In Fig. 2 , a set of SEM and AFM images of textured silicon surface are shown. A high density of pyramid-like structures is observed for all cases, however, the best results in terms of Black Silicon surface appearance are observed when CH4 is present in the gas mixture (as it was confirmed later with the reflectance characterization). For both mixtures, SF6/O2 and SF6/O2/CH4, under different conditions of pressure and RF power, the DC self-bias does not exhibit a considerable change, and a similar behavior with the roughness is observed, for this reason similar pyramid-like structures can be obtained. Texturing time was fixed in 20min for all samples. In the case of SF6/O2 plasmas, the Black Silicon formation is due to a competition among the etching process of silicon by fluorine radicals, the deposition of a SiO x F y film due the presence of oxygen, and the etching of this film by reactive ions like SF x +, fluorine and oxygen radicals as well. On the other hand, for SF6/O2/CH4 plasmas, another process contributes to the formation of Black Silicon, which is the deposition of a polymer CH x due the presence of methane. When CH4 is incorporated to the SF6/O2 mixture, the DC bias voltage is increased (as can be observed in Fig. 1). Ions can gain more energy and the passivation layer of polymer can be easily removed. Oxygen radicals also contribute to remove this polymer, and in this way the etching of silicon continues. In Fig. 2, all processes showed were textured during 20min. The best condition for the Black Silicon appearance was obtained for the SF6/O2/CH4 gas mixture with SF6 =30sccm, O2 =10sccm, CH4 =4sccm, 100W, 50mTorr, and 20min. In this case, the constant competition among etching of silicon, surface passivation for CH x or SiO x F y layers, and etching of these passivation layers promotes the formation of a Black Silicon surface. Fig. 3 shows the effect of the plasma texturing time using optimized conditions (SF6 =30sccm/O2 =10sccm/CH4 =4sccm, 100W, 50mTorr). For these conditions, the DC self-bias does not show a considerably increased when time is raised. However, the silicon surface appearance exhibits a considerably change. Optical microscopy images are inserted in Fig. 3A\u2013C in order to illustrate how the surface color goes from dark gray to black as time increases. At relatively short plasma time (Fig. 3A \u2013 20min), a low density of small and not well defined structures is observed. Even the structures are small in the c-Si surface at this stage; the color of the surface turns dark gray in comparison with the gray silicon surface without texturing. When time is increased (Fig. 3B \u2013 30min), the roughness of the silicon surface increases as well and pyramid-like structures start to form until a high density is obtained at a larger plasma time. The time for this condition is 45min for texturing (Fig. 3C). In fact, a black appearance of the surface is obtained. Texturing time plays an important role to attain a Black Silicon surface. The main goal during the Black Silicon formation for solar-cells applications is to achieve a low c-Si surface reflectance. With this, most of the light arriving to the wafer surface can be absorbed, generating a higher electron concentration and consequently a higher short circuit current (J sc). Fig. 4 shows the specular surface reflectance as function of wavelength (200\u2013900nm) of incident light in the textured samples processed under several conditions. The polished monocrystalline silicon sample without texturing, used as reference, exhibits the highest average reflectance (up to 35%). Reflectance decreases in the textured samples using both gas mixtures (SF6/O2 and SF6/O2/CH4). Moreover the lowest values of reflectance are observed in the samples textured using our optimized conditions for obtaining Black Silicon (SF6/O2/CH4 =30/10/4sccm, 100W, 50mTorr, and 45min). The average reflectance for this sample is 1%. Fig. 5 shows the diffuse surface reflectance as function of wavelength (400\u2013700nm) using the integrating spheres technique. Reflectance values increase when compared with specular reflectance. According to the characteristics of the samples surface (roughness surface), integrating spheres technique exhibits more accurate measurements. However, it is important to observe that lowest values of reflectance remain when the SF6/O2/CH4 gas mixture is used. For the sample using our optimized conditions for Black Silicon, the average reflectance is 4%. When halocarbon gas is used in texturing of silicon surface (methane in our case), the deposition of a polymer-like layer is clearly important mainly if the application of texturing is solar cells. A carbon layer modifies the composition of the original c-Si material affecting the optical and electrical response. To obtain information about the surface composition of textured samples, IR spectra were obtained. Fig. 6 shows absorbance spectra for textured samples using SF6/O2 and SF6/O2/CH4, the spectrum of a layer of SiC is used to compare the presence of important bonds. CC bonding between 1500 and 1600cm\u22121, and CH x between 2800 and 3000cm\u22121 [33,34] are not observed in textured samples. Then, the effect of the formation of a carbon layer during the texturing process can therefore be neglected. The constant competition between etching and deposition processes during texturing, and the correct balance among plasma parameters like RF power, pressure and flow rates could guarantee Black Silicon surface without carbon layer. It is important to point out that the SF6/O2/CH4 gas mixture used in this work has not been reported in literature for plasma texturing, and the structures produced with the optimized process, are similar to those produced by wet texturing. These structures in the c-Si surface are suitable for a reliable surface passivation, than those reported for SF6/O2 gas mixtures [21]. 4 Conclusions The process for the formation of pyramid-like structures using a SF6/O2/CH4 gas mixture has been achieved. An optimized plasma texturing process (gas flow rates, RF power, and time) has resulted on Black Silicon, providing a very low specular and diffuse reflectance values in the textured wafer surface. Polymer formation due to the use of CH4 in the gas mixture is likely to enhance the micro-masking effect, resulting on the formation of a high density of pyramid-like structures. The constant competition between etching and deposition processes during texturing, and the correct balance among plasma parameters like RF power, pressure and flow rates could guarantee Black Silicon surface without polymer layer. Average values of 1% and 4% for specular and diffuse reflectance respectively have been measured on textured c-Si wafers, processed with our optimized plasma process. Those results are a very promising alternative for low cost fabrication of c-Si solar cells, since the process is completely dry, no DI water, wet chemicals or photolithography are used.
