The effective surface recombination velocity Seff has been measured within a time frame of one year after activation of surface passivation. The results demonstrate that after an initial slight degradation during the first month Seff values stabilize around 45 and 25 cm/s on p- and n-type black silicon samples, respectively. These values are enough to guarantee stable high efficiency in interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) c-Si(n) solar cells (> 24.5%) using black silicon nanostructures on the front side. Similar, although weaker, losses are also observed in surface passivation on textured samples covered by Al2O3 with equal thickness, indicating that the origin of the instability might be independent of surface morphology. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Introduction Black silicon, from now on b-Si, reduces drastically surface reflectance in the useful absorption solar spectrum of c-Si solar cells [1, 2]. An interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) structure with their contact-free front surface simplifies the introduction of b-Si etching in the fabrication chain. In order to guarantee high efficiencies IBC c-Si solar cells not only low reflectance but also very good front surface passivation are mandatory. * Corresponding author.

Nowadays some works have demonstrated that excellent passivation of b-Si nanostructures can be reached using atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 films [3, 4]. Those films combine electrical and chemical passivation, achieving effective surface recombination velocities Seff well below 20 cm/s on p- and n-type c-Si and mc-Si materials. Recently lab-scale b-Si IBC cells passivated with ALD Al2O3 with efficiencies beyond 22% on both p\u00e2\u20ac\u201c and n- type c-Si substrates have been demonstrated [2, 5]. However, the passivation stability of b-Si covered by ALD Al2O3 films has not been analyzed yet. This aspect is crucial if b-Si etching wants to be introduced as a realistic alternative in the solar cell fabrication process. In this work we report on the one year passivation stability of ALD Al2O3 passivated b-Si using both p- and n- type substrates. 2. Experimental 2.1. Texturing and surface passivation High quality p- and n-type 2.7r0.2 :cm <100> FZ c-Si, 4\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wafers (285 r 10 um thickness) were used in the study. Black silicon was performed by etching both surfaces through a cryogenic inductively coupled plasma reactive-ion etching process (ICP-RIE) at -120 \u00c2\u00baC using SF6 and O2 as etching gases. As can be seen in Fig. 1ab, nano-texturing etching results in densely and randomly pillars distributed on the silicon surface with heights and widths less than 1 \u00c2\u2014m and 200 nm respectively. Reference samples were textured on both sides by anisotropic etching in tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), isopropanol (IPA) and DI water (320 ml:350 ml:3300 ml) at 80\u00c2\u00baC (75 min) resulting in random pyramid surfaces. After the etching, the wafers were RCA cleaned before the atomic layer deposition of 20 nm thick Al2O3 layer at 200\u00c2\u00baC for both b-Si and reference samples. In the ALD process, TMA was used as the aluminum source and water as the oxidant. After ALD Al2O3 passivation, all wafers were cut in quarters to explore the optimum annealing temperature previously to the monitoring of the surface passivation stability with the time. The annealing stage was performed in forming gas ambient during 15 min considering different annealing temperatures in the 375-450\u00c2\u00baC range.

(1), where w is the wafer thickness and Win the lifetime related to intrinsic recombination mechanisms (Auger and band to band) using the parametrization reported by Richter et al. [6]. Seff was always evaluated for an injection carrier excess of 'n=1015 cm-3 and samples were stored at room conditions in the dark between measurements. w Seff ineff 211 # WW (1) 3. Results 3.1. Annealing temperature study. Initial surface passivation It is well known that surface passivation activation of ALD Al2O3 films both on polished as well as on randomly textured c-Si surfaces requires a thermal annealing in the 350-450\u00c2\u00baC range [7]. For our b-Si samples, the best option is to perform the annealing around 400\u00c2\u00baC independently of the substrate polarity as is shown in Fig. 2. Excellent Seff values of 16.0 and 5.5 cm/s on p- and n-type material respectively are achieved (see table I). Notice that b-Si surface passivation is quite similar to that achieved on textured reference samples. Fig. 2. Seff vs. annealing temperature for random (squares) and b-Si (circles) textured surfaces on a) p- and b) n-type substrates. 3.2. Long-term surface passivation stability study Once initial surface passivation is activated, Seff was periodically monitored in both b-Si and randomly textured samples during one year (a8700 hours). As can be seen in Fig. 3, some slight surface passivation degradation, especially noticeable during the first month (< 1000 h), occurs on b-Si samples compared with their corresponding reference. However Seff seems to stabilize to values of 45 \u00c2\u00b1 10 and 25 \u00c2\u00b1 2 cm/s on p- and n-type substrates a) b) 350 375 400 425 450 475 1 10 100 Annealing temperature (oC) Random (20 nm Al2O3) b-Si (20 nm Al2O3) p-type E ff.

Therefore surface passivation quality changes from outstanding to very good at the end of the study. The origin of this surface passivation degradation is still unclear but it might be due to a slight loss of field-effect passivation, i.e. a decrease in charge with time in the Al2O3 film, which also explains the small increase of Seff on random textured samples with the same Al2O3 thickness. Notice that electrical passivation mechanism plays a crucial role in b-Si surfaces which are much more sensitive to charge than planar samples [4]. However more research is necessary to address final conclusions. Fig. 3.

Expected photovoltaic efficiencies on stable n-type IBC cells Taking into account stabilized Seff values we can predict final photovoltaic efficiencies of n-type IBC cells with b- Si at the front surface and device thickness about 260 \u00c2\u2014m using PC1D software [8]. For that purpose, we consider a back-junction structure (see inset in Fig. 4a) with the following constraints: a) the same front reflectance of a test 10-1 101 102 103 104 1 10 100 Initial Time after ALD deposition/anneal (h) Random (20 nm Al2O3) b-Si (20 nm Al2O3) p-type E ff.

Constraints b) and c) can be achieved easily in a state-of-art IBC cells based on rear point contact structure [9] or alternatively on the HIT concept [10], whereas consideration d) can be overcome using both a small pitch between base and emitter interdigitated regions, e.g. a 100 \u00c2\u2014m, and a two level metallization scheme. Efficiencies contours under standard test conditions (AM1.5G 1 kW/m2 solar spectrum and T=25\u00c2\u00baC) vs. bulk lifetime WBulk and effective front surface recombination velocity SF are shown in Fig 4b. It is clear that n-type IBC cells fabricated with high quality substrates, i.e. WBulk > a1 ms, can reach initial efficiencies and short-circuit current densities as high as 26.5% and 42.9 mA/cm2 respectively, relaxing to values up to 24.5% and 41.7 mA/cm2 once front surface passivation is stabilized with Seff values around 25 cm/s. We can conclude that Seff values, especially on n-type substrates, guarantee enough surface passivation to obtain high photovoltaic efficiencies even using a high demanding structure as is the IBC solar cell.

Conclusions In this work we report on the long-term stability of black silicon surfaces passivated with atomic layer deposited, (ALD), Al2O3 on p- and n-type FZ c-Si substrates. The effective surface recombination velocity Seff has been measured within a window time of one year after activation of surface passivation. Results demonstrate that after an initial slight degradation during the first month Seff values stabilize around 45 and 25 cm/s on p- and n-type black silicon samples respectively. These values are enough to guarantee stable high efficiency in interdigitated back- contacted c-Si(n) solar cells (> 24.5%) using black silicon nanostructures on the front side. The origin of this surface passivation degradation is still unclear but it might be due to a slight loss of field-effect passivation provided by the ALD Al2O3 films. 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 10001100 0 10 20 30 40 R ef le ct an ce R (% ) Wavelength O (nm) Emitter (Joe) c-Si(n) WBulk Seff b-Si + ALD Al2O3 a) b) 20 26 24 22 10-1 100 101 100 101 102 S ef f ( cm /s ) WBulk (ms) 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Efficiency (%) Final Initial 346 Eric Calle et al. / Energy Procedia 92 ( 2016 ) 341 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 346 Acknowledgements This work was partially supported by the Spanish MINECO (PCIN-2014-055) and Finnish TEKES (40329/14) agencies under Solar-Era.Net FP7 European Network.

The results are directly compared with random pyramid textured counterparts. The effective surface recombination velocity Seff has been measured within a time frame of one year after activation of surface passivation. The results demonstrate that after an initial slight degradation during the first month Seff values stabilize around 45 and 25cm/s on p- and n-type black silicon samples, respectively. These values are enough to guarantee stable high efficiency in interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) c-Si(n) solar cells (> 24.5%) using black silicon nanostructures on the front side. Similar, although weaker, losses are also observed in surface passivation on textured samples covered by Al2O3 with equal thickness, indicating that the origin of the instability might be independent of surface morphology.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2016-08-31", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876610216305203", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Calle, Eric"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ortega, Pablo"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "von Gastrow, Guillaume"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mart\u00edn, Isidro"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Savin, Hele"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Alcubilla, Ram\u00f3n"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876610216305203"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610216305203"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1876-6102(16)30520-3", "prism:volume": "92", "prism:publisher": "The Author(s).
