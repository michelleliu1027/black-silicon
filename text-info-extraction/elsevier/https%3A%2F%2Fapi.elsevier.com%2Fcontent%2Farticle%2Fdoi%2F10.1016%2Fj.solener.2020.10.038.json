In this work electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) is used to study the collection efficiency of emitters in industrial silicon solar cells. Laser-doped local emitters have been deployed industrially, yet in mas production they are designed wider than the screen-printed silver fingers to allow alignment tolerances. EBIC has allowed to image and quantify the laser-induced damage that occurs in these local emitter regions. A model is developed to account for such damage, so that losses in EQE could be quantified from the observed EBIC collection characteristics. The damaged regions present ~12% lower collection efficiency at short wavelength (300\u2013500 nm) than the homogenous emitter. Sentaurus TCAD simulations reveal that eliminating such damage would improve cell efficiency by ~0.12%. Additional degradation is found in a region 1\u20132 \u00b5m wide adjacent to the silver fingers, which has not been detected before. It is also found that pulsed laser doping leads to ~15 \u00b5m long un-doped gaps, along the direction of laser movement. As laser doping becomes a key part of industrial cell fabrication, it is crucial to develop a better understanding of the potential pitfalls, and future improvements to the process. The versatility of EBIC imaging is also demonstrated using FIB milling to improve lateral resolution and study the depth profile of boron emitters in newly developed industrial i-TOPCon cells. EBIC imaging, in combination with advanced device simulations, have proven powerful tools to elucidate carrier collection characteristics and drawbacks, thus helping to understand and improve fabrication processes at industrial level. Keywords Silicon solar cells PERC EBIC Recombination Laser doped selective emitter 1 Introduction The continuous improvement of industrial crystalline Si solar cells requires deep understanding of performance losses, along with the development of new processes that lead to yet more efficient solar panels. Minimising non-radiative recombination has been a crucial development in solar research in the past few decades. Key advances include the improvements in silicon production, including single crystal (Glunz et al., 1999), multi-crystalline (Benick et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015), and most recently cast mono material (Schubert et al., 2021). Surface passivation processes have also evolved extraordinarily (Bonilla et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2018), and their industrial adoption has enabled mass-scale deployment of passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) silicon solar cells (Blakers, 2019; Green, 2015). Most recently the understanding of hydrogenation processes has also pushed performance, while avoiding detrimental module degradation (Hallam et al., 2017, 2020; Hamer et al., 2017). Further advances in the control of recombination processes will continue to play a key role in the development of PV technologies (Nayak et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2018). Hence, identifying and understanding recombination remains essential in meeting the requirements for future performance improvements. Electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) is a characterisation tool traditionally employed for integrated circuit failure analysis (Leamy, 1982). There has also been increasing interest in applying EBIC to photovoltaic devices, since it allows studying the recombination activity at defects (Adamczyk et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2004), extracting diffusion lengths (Kittler and Seifert, 1989), and locating the p-n junction in devices (Hallam et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017). EBIC employs high energy electrons in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to generate electron-hole pairs (ehp). When the electron beam is scanned across a sample, the collected carriers give rise to a current, which is recorded as a function of beam position (Leamy, 1982). The working principle of EBIC technique is analogous to solar cell operation, with the advantage of providing submicron scale carrier excitation in the cell. Such local generation is hence helpful in indicating the efficiency of carrier separation and collection as a function of space, in the 10\u2013100 nm length scales. To the best of our knowledge, nanoscale resolution in studying electrical activity of a semiconductor device can be achieved by no other technique (Durose et al., 2004). Contrast in the EBIC signal is observed due to variation in the collection efficiency, which relates to the presence and strength of recombination centres within the material. Therefore, direct comparison between sections of the material with homogenous lifetime and those with defect-related degradation, allows the recombination activity to be quantified. This has been widely used in evaluating recombination at impurity-decorated grain boundaries and dislocations (Chen et al., 2004; Maximenko et al., 2010). EBIC has also been used in combination with composition and structural characterisation techniques, providing a tool to relate the electrical quality to the atomic level structure of the material (Stoffers et al., 2015; Tweddle et al., 2019, 2018). While it is known that nanoscale defects can hamper the performance of mono- and multi-crystalline silicon cells, most techniques have reported millimetre to micron spatial resolution. For example, cell degradation has been investigated using photoluminescence (PL) imaging in the tens of microns scale (Nie et al., 2020; Trupke et al., 2006), and more recently micro PL has also been used to study and optimize local doping processes with micron scale spatial resolution (Nguyen et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2014). The highest resolution without an electron beam has been shown with a micro light beam induced current ( \u03bc LBIC) setup, which was used to provide Jsc maps in the scale of ~0.1\u20132 \u03bc m (Breitwieser et al., 2014; Sporleder et al., 2019), yet it required SEM to image the cell topography. A comprehensive study linking electrical activity to submicron scale defects in localised regions of commercial cells is yet to be reported. Moreover, the increasing use of thinner silicon substrates, dielectric films, and contact metallization requires techniques capable to identify losses at the micro and nanometre scales. Examples of this trend are the development and adoption of selective emitters for high throughput industrial production (Altermatt et al., 2018; Brand et al., 2018), requiring additional doping under a 30\u201340 \u03bc m wide metal finger. Other examples include the recently developed nanoscale front surface texturing (Davidsen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014; Rahman et al., 2017; Savin et al., 2015). Considering that such progress relies on device features in the micron scale, effective determination of carrier losses in small local scales and at high resolution will become increasingly necessary. For this, we apply EBIC in this paper to locate and understand the root cause of recombination losses, and suggest improvements in future device processing. In this work we first report observations of collection efficiency loss at laser-doped selective emitters on a PERC, and its dependency on electron beam energy using EBIC imaging. Then we present the process of developing a model to account for the laser damage, which is used to evaluate the effect of such damage on cell performance. Lastly, additional degradation adjacent to silver fingers and un-doped gaps in selective emitter found on PERC cells, as well as improved lateral resolution in EBIC imaging by FIB milling on industrial i-TOPCon cells are reported. 2 EBIC setup and specimen preparation EBIC measurements here were carried out in a Zeiss NVision 40 FIB-SEM, attached with an Oxford Instruments Omniprobe100 micromanipulator, and Point Electronic EBIC current amplifier. The rear (base) contact on all devices was earthed to the SEM stub. After examination under secondary-electron (SE) mode, the micromanipulator was made contact to the doped emitter either directly on the emitter surface, or on the metallisation. EBIC images were then acquired at various accelerating voltages (4\u201316 kV) using the software package DISS5 supplied by Point Electronic. Two EBIC acquisition structures were used here: plan-view and cross-sectional. In Fig. 1 a, the plane of the collecting p-n junction is perpendicular to the irradiated surface, which represents the plan-view; whereas in Fig. 1b the junction lies in the plane of the irradiated surface to obtain cross-sectional view. In a subset of specimens, FIB (focused ion beam) under the same instrument was used to mill the samples surface. The Zeiss NVision 40 is equipped with a gallium liquid-metal ion source used for milling at different current and accelerating voltages as will be detailed alongside the results. The benefits of FIB milling have been outlined in previous work (Haney et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2020). Silicon cells were produced at Trina Solar and diced into microscopy specimens at Oxford. Since different cells processing was studied, the details of each cell will be described in Sections 3\u20135. Manual cleavage was adopted for EBIC specimen preparation. Wafers were first scribed near the edges using a diamond scribe pen and cleaved by separating the two parts using tweezers. By repeating the cleaving process, samples of size near 10\u201330 mm2 were obtained, so that they could be fixed on a SEM stub holder. For plan-view studies the specimens were flat mounted onto an SEM stub, using silver dag. For cross-sectional studies the specimens were attached to a 90\u00b0 bent Al sheet, held to an SEM stub. SE (secondary electron) signal was collected together with EBIC signal. The two data sets were mixed into one image for visualization using the software ImageJ, as described in (Zhou et al., 2020). 3 Selective emitter laser doping in commercial PERC cells PERC cells have recently become the mainstream technology of the photovoltaics industry (Blakers, 2019; Dullweber and Schmidt, 2016; Green, 2015). One feature of PERC cells is that the region underneath the front metal contact is laser-doped to create a selective emitter, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . This decreases the contact resistance and recombination at the Si/metal interface. Due to alignment tolerances between lasering and screen printing, the extent of the n++ doped region is larger than the width of the silver finger to ensure that the finger lies within the laser-doped region on its entire length, which is ~160 mm. Further details on the manufacturing process and ongoing optimisation of PERC cells can be found in (Altermatt et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2015; Stenzel et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2017). 3.1 Imaging and characterising laser-induced damage EBIC measurements were conducted in plan-view in the vicinity of the silver contacts and revealed that the laser doping has a significant impact on the collection efficiency of photo-generated carriers. Fig. 3 displays EBIC and SE images of the region near a metal finger. The SE image (Fig. 3a) was combined with the EBIC image (Fig. 3b) in Fig. 3c, with the EBIC signal in red so that recombination can be assigned to specific regions. Fig. 3d illustrates a higher magnification EBIC/SE micrograph at the border between the n++ selective emitter and the n+ emitter region. Fig. 3e shows histograms of EBIC signal in the two regions. Laser damage can be spotted from both the EBIC and SE signals in Fig. 3d. In the SE signal it is evident that the pyramids in the undamaged region are in pristine condition with sharp tips, compared to re-solidified blunted pyramid tips in the damaged region. The EBIC contrast in Fig. 3c, and d at higher magnification, together with the difference in histograms in Fig. 3e, indicate loss in collection efficiency in the n++ region. The loss can be explained by two factors: the difference in doping produced by the laser, and the introduction of extra defects at or near the surface. In heavily doped phosphorus regions, concentrations of active dopant above 1020 cm\u22123 are produced and Auger recombination can become a dominant source of performance loss (Redfield, 1978). The effect of inactive phosphorus dopants can also play a substantial role as it introduces defect states that act as heavy SRH recombination centers (Min et al., 2014a, 2014b), due to dopant atoms forming precipitates and clusters (Schmidt and Stickler, 1964; Velichko et al., 2005). This region is referred to as the dead layer, due to its high recombination rate. Its thickness relates to the doping concentration, with higher doping concentration leading to thicker dead layers. Laser doping drives phosphorus atoms at the surface deeper into the bulk as has been confirmed by other researchers (Brand et al., 2018), and also here using an electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) profile (Figure S2). As a result, it is possible that the lasered region contains a large portion of such detrimental precipitates, and thus the observed lower collection efficiency. The SE/EBIC images and the histograms of EBIC current collection demonstrate that for these processing conditions, the extra recombination is significant. Another feature evident in Fig. 3d is that the EBIC signal at the top of pyramids is much lower than at the valley in both damaged and undamaged region. This could be due to three reasons: a topography effect, higher recombination rate at the tips than in the valleys, or difference in junction depth. Fig. 4 illustrates the topography artefact in which the pyramidal texture would lead to more SE emission from the peaks compared to the valley. At the valleys most SEs cannot escape but interact with Si and generate more electron-hole pairs. This in turn leads to more EBIC current collected at the valley than at the top of the pyramids. The electron beam current collected by the cell was measured without the Omniprobe current metre connected to the emitter, for both undamaged and damaged regions. In the laser-damaged region the ratio between the beam current at the tip at the valley is 0.465 \u00b1 0.048, while in the undamaged region it is 0.423 \u00b1 0.052 (measurements were taken at 5 kV). The reduced beam current at the tip, equally observed in the damaged and undamaged region, demonstrates the apparent higher collection in the valleys largely originates as an artefact of the electron beam generation profile, and is only weakly related to the selective emitter lasering. Another possibility is that the dead layer or laser damage is thicker at the top of pyramids, leading to higher recombination rate and hence lower current collected. And last, a deeper junction at the tip could also lead to less collection of ehp generated close to the surface, contributing to the difference in EBIC signal collected at the tip and at the valley of a pyramid. To assess this, cross-sectional EBIC of these PERC cells was conducted. Fig. 5 shows cross-section image of a PERC cell, in which it is clear that the tips of the pyramids are blunted by the laser, and that the junction is slightly deeper from the surface at the top of the pyramids than the valleys, as has been reported in (Meng et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2012). The EBIC signal is also seen to decrease at the top of the pyramids in Fig. 5, which cannot be explained by the generation artefact as described in Fig. 4. This indicated reduced collection efficiency at the tips of the pyramids, more evident for the blunted lasered region. This effect is very minor in the undamaged pyramids in Fig. 5, indicating that the EBIC contrast between top and valleys is more likely related to the generation artefact in Fig. 4. 3.2 Collection loss dependency on electron beam energy The loss in collection efficiency was quantified by comparing the total EBIC current collected over a defined area in the two regions, as shown in Fig. 3e. A relative collection efficiency is defined as the ratio of the total EBIC current in the laser-doped region to that of the undamaged region. Fig. 6 shows the relative collection efficiency between the two regions for accelerating voltages ranging from 4 kV to 16 kV. Histograms for all beam energies are given in the supplementary materials, Figure S1. It is clear that the relative efficiency depends on electron energy, with the ratio being as low as 0.49 at 4 kV, but 0.95 at 10 kV. This relates to the difference in depth that the beam electrons penetrate and transfer their energy to generate ehp, at different accelerating voltages. Fig. 7 .a shows the generation profile of electron beam at different accelerating voltages, following the model from Werner\u2019s work (Werner et al., 1988). From this figure, it is clear that a large portion of ehp\u2019s are generated closer to the surface for lower accelerating voltage. A low relative efficiency at low accelerating voltage indicates that the ehp generated close to the surface is more likely to recombine rather than getting collected by the p-n junction. The trend in Fig. 6 therefore implies that the damage introduced by laser is primarily at the surface, which might have an effect on the collection of ehp generated from low wavelength light. Fig. 7b shows the generation profile of light with wavelength between 300 and 500 nm. The generation profile for each wavelength was obtained from ray tracing using the software Sunrays (Brendel, 1995) and using pyramids with 0.1 um height. When compared with the 4 kV electron beam, a larger portion of carriers for 300 nm and 350 nm light is generated within the first 0.1 \u00b5m from the surface, implying that a substantial collection loss could be expected for this low wavelength light. Even for 400 and 450 nm wavelength light, a large portion of carriers are generated within 0.2 \u00b5m. A quantitative assessment of the extent of such losses is next approached using a Sentaurus device model to calculate the external quantum efficiency (EQE) on a device where the laser damage is present. 4 Understanding losses using TCAD device simulations Sentaurus TCAD device modelling was used to quantify cell efficiency loss originating from laser damage. A model was generated to represent (i) the standard n+ undamaged emitter, and (ii) the n++ laser-doped region. The parameters used in the models are included in Table 1 . Fig. 8 shows the ratio of Jsc between the two regions, obtained both experimentally and by simulation. A SRH surface recombination velocity (SRV) for holes of Sp = 103 cm/s was chosen for the undamaged n+ emitter region, following average values reported in the literature (Fell et al., 2015; Min et al., 2017). For the laser-damaged region, Sp = 107 cm/s (the thermal velocity) was initially used in model 1 to evaluate the effect of purely surface degradation. The results in Fig. 8 indicate that purely modifying the SRV is not enough to reproduce the observed behaviour. In model 2, a laser-induced redistribution of phosphorus dopants was included besides setting the SRV to thermal velocity. The phosphorus profiles for both regions can be found in the supplementary materials, Figure S1. Fig. 8 shows that the Jsc ratio for model 2 is lower and closer to the experimental data than that of model 1, which indicates that the increased Auger recombination at the surface leads to a significant decrease in collection efficiency. In order to construct a better fitting model, a surface damage region was added in model 3, with the lifetime reduced to \u03c4p = 10\u221212 s in the first 10 nm, and 10\u221211 s from 10 to 60 nm. It was found that such a layer of damage was required to reproduce the observed experimental data best, as shown in Fig. 8. Accounting for (i) a high recombination rate at the surface, (ii) a redistributed phosphorus profile, and (iii) an introduction of defects at the surface was necessary to successfully reproduce the observed laser damage in device simulations. Accurately explaining the observed EBIC measurements required a model with a damaged region in the top 60 nm, thus proving that the laser induced damage is primarily at the surface. The process of developing a TCAD model to fit the experimental data is crucial in identifying the root cause of laser-induced losses of collection efficiency, and how to minimize them. With the model 0 for undamaged region and model 3 for damaged region, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was simulated to relate the damage to the carrier collection. The generation profiles calculated from SUNRAYS were used for this (Brendel, 1995). Fig. 9 a shows the EQE results, with EQE at damaged region exhibiting between 50 and 90% lower collection than that of the undamaged region, for wavelengths between 300 and 500 nm. The EQE for the laser damaged region improves as wavelength increases, approaching that of the undamaged region when the wavelength is above 680 nm. This is explained by a larger proportion of carriers being generated further from the surface for such higher wavelengths. Similar findings have been reported on a selective emitter structure chemically back etched (Joonwichien et al., 2018). To evaluate the effect of laser damage on the cell operation under standard operating conditions, the solar irradiance at specific wavelengths in a solar spectrum was equated with the EQE found for the two regions. This results in the wavelength-dependent power generation from irradiated sunlight. The AM1.5 global tilt solar spectrum was used here as specified in (\u201cASTM G173-03, Standard Tables for Reference Solar Spectral Irradiances: Direct Normal and Hemispherical on 37\u00b0 Tilted Surface, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2003, www.astm.org,\u201d n.d.). Fig. 9b shows that ~12% of the current are lost at wavelengths between 300 nm and 500 nm as an effect of laser damage. Identifying the width of the laser doped region and the resulting collection loss is important to determine the effect of the damage on a complete cell. To assess the total loss in performance in complete cells, Sentaurus TCAD simulations were conducted in a typical industrial PERC architecture. The laser damage was included using the Model 3, and the device was based in those reported in (Bonilla et al., 2020; Min et al., 2017) with 35 \u00b5m wide metal fingers, 1.4 mm finger spacing, and 1 \u03a9.cm base resistance. The complete model parameters are included in the supplementary materials. The laser damage and additional doping of the n++ selective emitter region was 100 \u00b5m wide, directly underneath the fingers. Table 2 shows the parameters obtained for such complete cell with the selective emitter with and without its associated damage. For the model with laser damage, efficiency was decreased by ~0.12% from 22.84% to 22.72%, with Voc decreased by 4 mV compared with the one with undamaged local emitter. Light JV and dark JV of both models were used to extract cell parameters from PVLighthouse (www.pvlighthouse.com.au, 2017), showing an increase of saturation current (J01) from 0.13 to 0.145 pA/cm2 by addition of selective emitter. This indicates the potential losses in performance occurring as a result of laser damage in the selective emitter, which were identified thanks to the combination of EBIC measurements and TCAD modelling. 5 Losses associated with Ag metallisation in PERC cells We analysed a cell whose front metal fingers were fabricated in the laboratory with a recently acquired screen-printer designed for mass production. The new screen printing enabled 25 \u00b5m wide silver fingers, similar to those reported in (Beaucarne et al., 2019). The combined SE/EBIC images of standard 35 \u00b5m fingers, and new 25 \u00b5m fingers in PERC cells are shown in Fig. 10 a and b. The horizontal darker lines are artefacts induced by contact instability during the imaging experiment at Oxford. In both cells the laser-doped regions are evident from the loss in collection efficiency. In addition, there is a region with even lower EBIC signal vertically adjacent to the finger ( < 5 \u00b5m, labelled dark region in Fig. 10). Such regions observed under an optical microscope does not appear to be residual metallisation paste. It therefore may be caused by the migration of contaminants, such as Ag (Hilali et al., 2004) contained in the frits, during the process of firing or may be caused by infrared radiation during firing that is reflected off the finger (Fields et al., 2016). This region with low collection efficiency is wider around the 25 \u00b5m finger than around the 35 \u00b5m one, which means a potential larger loss in cell performance. Fig. 10c shows two regions where the EBIC signal is considerably higher, within the usual laser-doped selective emitter. These regions most probably received insufficient laser doping because the laser head moved too fast between laser pulses, in the typical nanosecond switched lasers used in industry (Lin et al., 2020). Such lower doping concentration can lead to locally higher contact resistance with the metal contact, which does not affect cell efficiency because current flow across the contact interface is dominated by the regions with sufficient laser doping. However, such regions may cause recombination at the metal interface. In Fig. 10c, a ~100 \u00b5m long laser-doped region is surrounded by two ~15 \u00b5m long non-lasered gaps, leading to 13% of the area under the contact that would cause excess recombination. These findings are in agreement with previous works where pulsing of the laser was found to produce an intermittent pattern (Bonse et al., 2013). However, experience shows that laser pulses that overlap excessively are more detrimental than small gaps (Brand et al., 2018). These micrometre scale features are only observed by EBIC imaging with submicron resolution, which allows linking them to specific laser processing. These findings help understanding and improving cell fabrication processes. 6 Characterising boron doped emitters in TOPCon cells Fig. 11 shows the structure of an n-type i-TOPCon cell fabricated by Trina Solar (Chen et al., 2020, 2019). The p-n junction of the cell was fabricated by boron diffusion. It is well known that both boron diffusion and screen-printing are more difficult to attain than phosphorus diffusions. Mapping the p-n junction is therefore important to ensure high quality manufacturing in n-type cells. EBIC measurements on a cleaved sample were conducted using a cross sectional approach. 5 kV was chosen to overcome the noise due to electrical interference and avoid any potential shift in peak position. FIB milling using a Ga beam at 30 kV energy and 1 pA current, was carried out for 4 min to enhance the resolution of the junction imaging, and new EBIC images were acquired again at 5 kV. Fig. 12 shows combined SE/EBIC local images of the junction, (a) before, and (b) after FIB milling. After FIB, the full width at half maximum of the EBIC signal is reduced from 1.05 \u00b5m to 0.53 \u00b5m, showing that FIB milling is a functional method of improving the EBIC resolution. In Fig. 12b, the average distance between the Ag-Si interface and the maximum of the EBIC signal, i.e. the emitter junction depth, is 1.4 \u00b5m, with the junction deeper at the top of the pyramids than at the valleys, as is also found in the phosphorus emitter in Fig. 5. This also shows that screen-printing does not cause any spikes to the p-n junction, which was obtained only after a long series of paste and firing development. 7 Conclusions This work has reported the detection and quantification of laser-induced damage on selective emitters, via means of EBIC imaging and Sentaurus TCAD simulations. A model of both the laser-doped region and the undamaged region is developed, with EQE simulated to evaluate the effect of the damage. These have equated to a loss in efficiency of 0.12%. Additional degradation is found wider around new 25 \u00b5m wide fingers than the standard 35 \u00b5m ones. Un-doped gaps are also observed along the direction of laser movement as a result of the use of pulsed laser, which would cause excess recombination. Lastly, EBIC images of cross section of TOPCon cells show a uniform boron-doped emitter with an average depth of 1.4 \u00b5m. Improved resolution was achieved via FIB milling, and allowed to observe that the junction is deeper at the top of the pyramids than the valleys, as it is the case in a phosphorus emitter. EBIC imaging used in this study is shown to be a powerful analysis tool to probe the electrical characteristics of solar cells with sub-micrometre scale resolution. As cell efficiencies are becoming closer to the practical efficiency limit in mass production, more and more features on a sub-micron scale become important sources of losses. EBIC can provide valuable insight into such features and point to strategies for improvement.

Laser-doped local emitters have been deployed industrially, yet in mas production they are designed wider than the screen-printed silver fingers to allow alignment tolerances. EBIC has allowed to image and quantify the laser-induced damage that occurs in these local emitter regions. A model is developed to account for such damage, so that losses in EQE could be quantified from the observed EBIC collection characteristics. The damaged regions present ~12% lower collection efficiency at short wavelength (300\u2013500 nm) than the homogenous emitter. Sentaurus TCAD simulations reveal that eliminating such damage would improve cell efficiency by ~0.12%. Additional degradation is found in a region 1\u20132 \u00b5m wide adjacent to the silver fingers, which has not been detected before. It is also found that pulsed laser doping leads to ~15 \u00b5m long un-doped gaps, along the direction of laser movement. As laser doping becomes a key part of industrial cell fabrication, it is crucial to develop a better understanding of the potential pitfalls, and future improvements to the process. The versatility of EBIC imaging is also demonstrated using FIB milling to improve lateral resolution and study the depth profile of boron emitters in newly developed industrial i-TOPCon cells. EBIC imaging, in combination with advanced device simulations, have proven powerful tools to elucidate carrier collection characteristics and drawbacks, thus helping to understand and improve fabrication processes at industrial level.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2020-11-15", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X20310987", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Yu, Mingzhe"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhou, Ruinan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hamer, Phillip"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chen, Daming"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Xueling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Altermatt, Pietro P."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wilshaw, Peter R."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bonilla, Ruy S."}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X20310987"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X20310987"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0038-092X(20)31098-7", "prism:volume": "211", "prism:publisher": "International Solar Energy Society.
