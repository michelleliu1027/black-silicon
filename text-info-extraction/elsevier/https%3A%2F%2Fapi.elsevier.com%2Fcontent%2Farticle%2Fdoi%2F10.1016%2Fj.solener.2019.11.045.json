Institute of Microelectronics of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100029 China Graphical abstract An additive was developed in Ag-MACE process to prepare black silicon with uniform texturing, as a result, both the appearance and output-performance of solar cells were improved. It is important for uniform texture on crystallites with different orientation of diamond wire sawn multi-crystalline silicon solar cells by Ag metal-assisted chemical etching method (Ag-MACE). In this paper, an additive was adopted to make the nanostructures on crystallites with different orientation of multi-crystalline silicon wafers with roughly the same depth and diameter. This additive contains biological enzymes, which are macromolecular proteins with specific catalytic functions. The uniform texture produced by the additive is demonstrated to be helpful in improving the cell performance in terms of surface morphology, reflectivity, effective minority carrier lifetime, auger recombination rate, internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency measurements as well as electroluminescence spectra characterizations. The chemical mechanism of additive assisted etching reaction during the texturing process was discussed. Finally, mass-produced multi-crystalline silicon solar cells made by Ag-MACE with the additive achieve a maximum efficiency and average efficiency of 19.56%, and 19.24%, respectively, which were 0.65% and 0.64% absolutely higher than that without the additive. Moreover, the effective minority carrier lifetime and auger recombination rate of the former was nearly twice and a third of that of the latter respectively. Keywords Multi-crystalline silicon solar cell Diamond wire sawn Metal-assisted chemical etching Uniform textures Additive 1 Introduction With the depletion of non-renewable fossil resources such as coal, oil and natural gas, photovoltaic industry has attracted more and more attention due to their simplicity and low cost (Huang, 2015; Savin and Black, 2015; Yang, 2016; Kou, 2016; Wu, 2018; Mitra, 2019; Zhuoyin Peng, 2018; Zhang, 2018; Chaofan Zheng, 2017; Yuan, 2009; Fuyuki, 2005; Kafle, 2015; Huang, 2010; Mrazkova, 2018; Stapf, 2017; Zou, 2018; Peng, 2005; Huang, 2015; Hu, 2011; Zhang, 2009; Tao, 2016; Wang, 2017). The reflectance of diamond-wire-swan (DWS) multi-crystalline silicon treated by Ag metal-assisted chemical etching method (Ag-MACE) is as low as 3%, which is much lower than that by conventional acid etching method (Su, 2018). This silicon is called black silicon because of its extremely low reflectivity (Savin and Black, 2015). So solar cells made from them could convert more incident light energy into electrical energy, thus improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency (Wang, 2018). Therefore, it is an inevitable trend to use Ag-MACE instead of conventional acid etching. However, multi-crystalline Si consists of many crystallites with different orientations and electrochemical properties, so it is difficult to gain uniform texture on different crystallites by Ag-MACE (Cao, 2015). There are many other methods to prepare black Si, such as electrochemical etching (Zhang, 2006), microwave and plasma texturing (Boksenbojm and Wynants, 2009), reactive ion etching (RIE) (Xia, 2012), atmospheric pressure F2 based dry etching (Kafle, 2015), plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) (Shen, 2013); femtosecond laser technique (Crouch, 2004), Cu- MACE, mechanical scribing (Zhang, 2018; Polycrystalline silicon), masked dry and wet etching (Hauser, 2012; Nanoimprint) etc. These methods have problems of one sort or another. For example, RIE has a low yield; PIII is expensive and Cu-MACE will bring very high cost to treat the waste liquid, because of the large amount of copper in the solution. So, they are not suitable for industrial production. Up to now, Ag-MACE is the only method that realizes mass-production of black Si due to its strong feasibility (Dai, 2018). However, there is still one problem for multi-crystalline black silicon by Ag-MACE method: the uneven texture on different crystallites. The black Si prepared by this method can be seen by naked eyes with obvious differences between crystallites with different orientations, which leads to the uneven microstructure of its surface and the poor passivation of the subsequent silicon nitride (SiNx) film (Wang, 2017). All these factors make solar cells less efficient, and the market does not accept such multi-crystalline black Si. In the previous work, our group has studied the influence of surface structure on diffusion and passivation in multi-crystalline Si solar cells textured by Ag-MACE (Dai, 2018), and researched the influence of black Si morphology modification by acid etching on the properties of DWS multi-crystalline Si wafer (Su, 2018), and studied the post-treatment process of multi-crystalline black Si and got the efficient of 18.88% (Wang, 2018). Up to now, uniform texturing is still a problem for our mass production of high efficiency multi-crystalline black Si solar cells. In this work, we focused on the uniform texturing of multi-crystalline black Si during the mass production. An additive developed by our research group was adopted to the etching solution during the process of Ag-MACE. Uniform texturing was achieved by our black Si which featured with blurred boundary between crystallites with different orientations. The influence of additive on the etching depth, etching rate as well as the final surface morphology of multi-crystalline black Si was investigated. At the same time, the chemical mechanism of additive assisted etching process was discussed. And finally, the highest efficiency, average efficiency, average short circuit current (Isc), average open circuit voltage (Voc) and average fill factor (FF) of 19.56%, 19.24%, 37.66 mA/cm2, 637 mV and 80.23% were obtained for a batch of black Si solar cells using additive, respectively, which exhibited a great improvement in solar cell performance when compared to that solar cells without additive (18.91%, 18.60%, 36.83 mA/cm2, 629 mV, 80.56%). Therefore, the additive we developed has a promising market in photovoltaic field. 2 Experimental P-type commercial DWS multi-crystalline silicon wafers (156.75 \u00d7 156.75 mm2) with a thickness of 200 \u00b1 20 \u00b5m and resistivity of 1\u20133 \u03a9 cm was used as a substrate. The experimental steps are shown in Fig. 1 (labeled Step1 to Step9 in turn). First, hot KOH aqueous solution was used to remove the cut damaged layer on the surface of raw Si, after that, those wafers were rinsed in deionized water. Ag nanoparticles were then deposited on the surface of multi-crystalline Si by immersing the wafers in a solution of HF, AgNO3 and deionized water (DIW). After that, the wafers were divided into two groups, one immersed in a solution containing HF, H2O2, DIW (labeled as Group-A) and the other in the solution containing HF, H2O2, DIW and additive (labeled as Group-B). Then all silicon wafers were immersed in a solution of HF, HNO3 and DIW to enlarge the nanostructures on the surface of the wafers. Finally, these wafers were treated with silver removal and dried by hot nitrogen. In particular, in this experiment, all conditions were kept same except for the condition in Step3. After these steps, the black Si wafers are called black Si. Then, solar cells were fabricated based on these black Si using standard manufacturing processes, as shown in Fig. 1. The main steps in turn are phosphorus diffusion to form PN junction, edge etching of removing the edge and back PN junctions and phosphorsilicate glass (PSG) layer, SiNx coating by PECVD, screen printing and firing to form metal contacts. Surface morphology was characterized using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S4800). Reflectance was measured by Incident Photon to Charge Carrier Efficiency (IPCE) of solar cells measurement system (IBS\u2022SYSCOS). Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured by IPCE of solar cells measurement system (Sofn, 7-SCSpec, China). The minority carrier lifetime was measured by quasi-steady-state photo-conductance method with a Sinton WCT-120, and the surface lifetime mapping was conducted by Semilab PV-2000. The sheet resistance was tested by 4D auto four points probe meter (MODEL 280). The electrical performance of solar cells was characterized by a current-voltage (I-V) measurement system (under AM1.5G, R.T.). Electroluminescence image was measured by EL sorting machine (Zhewei, SA-220, China). 3 Results and discussion In Step2, when the silicon wafers were immersed in an aqueous solution of HF and AgNO3, the silver ion Ag+ will react with silicon through redox and become Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the silicon wafers. Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of the potential of silicon and other substances. The chemical equation of Ag+ and Si is shown by Eq. (1). Because silver is more electronegative than silicon (Peng, 2006). The silver ions in the solution snatch electrons from the silicon and are reduced to silver nanoparticles. (1) Ag + + S i + 2 H 2 O = A g + S i O 2 + h + + 2 H 2 \u2191 After Step2, Ag nanoparticles deposited on the crystallites with different orientation (taking \u30081 1 0\u3009 and \u30081 0 0\u3009 orientations for example) were observed respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 , in which the white particles were Ag nanoparticles. It can be seen that there was no difference between them, and all of them could be deposited uniformly. The reason for this is that the deposition of Ag nanoparticles is almost independent of the orientation of crystallite (Peng, 2006). Fig. 4 a and b are the SEM cross sectional images of the Si wafer after the treatment by Step3a containing no additive, where Fig. 4a is the SEM image of the crystallite with \u30081 0 0\u3009 orientation and Fig. 4b with \u30081 1 0\u3009. Also, Fig. 4c and d shows the surface morphology of crystallites with \u30081 0 0\u3009 and \u30081 1 0\u3009 orientations, which were treated by Step3b containing additive. As can be seen from Fig. 4, when there is no additive in the solution, the depths of the nano-pores on crystallites with \u30081 1 0\u3009 orientation in Fig. 4b are about 200 nm shallower than that of crystallites with \u30081 0 0\u3009 orientation in Fig. 4a. Notably, when the additive was added into the solution, the depths of the nano-pores on crystallites with \u30081 1 0\u3009 orientation in Fig. 4d was almost the same as that with \u30081 0 0\u3009 as shown in Fig. 4c. After step4, the front SEM images of the nano-pores were measured as shown in Fig. 5 . Unsurprisingly, the diameters of the nano-pores on crystallites with \u30081 0 0\u3009 orientation were obviously larger than that with \u30081 1 0\u3009 orientation treated with Step3a (no additive in the solution), while, for the wafers treated by Step3b (with additive in the solution), there was no significant difference in the diameters of nanopores on the crystallites with different orientations. Not only that, the appearance of the black Si treated by different conditions is also very different. As shown in Fig. 6 , it can be seen with the naked eye that the crystallites with different orientation of the black Si processed by Step3a are obviously different. On the contrary, the crystallites of Group-B are not obviously different, and taken a whole, the surface of the black Si is so blurry that you can barely see the boundaries between the different crystallites. These phenomena are caused by the different etching velocities of the Ag-MACE on the crystallites with different orientation (Yuan, 2012; Wang, 2017). Fig. 7 a\u2013f shows schematic drawing for the process of Ag-MACE. Etching velocity is accelerated by the Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the Si. Originally, HF, H2O2 and Si only have ordinary chemical reaction, However, with Ag nanoparticles involved, the common chemical reaction turns into electrochemical reaction that can be described as two half-cell reactions namely cathode reaction (Eq. (2) and (3)) and anode reaction (Eq. (4) and (5)). The electrons in the silicon are transported to the surface of the silicon wafer through Ag nanoparticles and absorbed by the holes, so the Si is oxidized to SiO2. And the SiO2 is etched by HF to form a pit beneath the Ag nanoparticles. The Ag nanoparticles then fall into the pits and so on, eventually nano-pores are formed on the Si wafers. (2) Ag + + e - \u2192 A g (3) H 2 O 2 + 2 H + \u2192 2 H 2 O + 2 h + (4) Si + 2 H 2 O \u2192 S i O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e - (5) Si O 2 + 6 H F \u2192 H 2 S i F 6 + 2 H 2 O It is well known that the linear and surface densities of silicon atoms of crystallites with different orientation are different, and the Si atoms density, which is the largest in \u30081 1 0\u3009 Si, and smallest in \u30081 0 0\u3009. So, the \u30081 1 0\u3009 crystallites are densest, and \u30081 0 0\u3009 sparsest. Therefore, when Ag nanoparticles assist the etching process and no additive was added into the solution, the etching speed of \u30081 0 0\u3009 crystallites are fastest, and that of \u30081 1 0\u3009 crystallites are slowest. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b, the depths of nano-pores on \u30081 0 0\u3009 crystallites are the largest, while that on \u30081 1 0\u3009 crystallites are the smallest. When the additive is added, the additive contains biological enzymes, which are large proteins with specific catalytic functions. The protein molecule contains a large number of hydroxyl groups. In water solution, the hydroxyl groups can easily combine with the silicon atoms, which reduces the chance of silicon atoms combine with hydrogen peroxide. As a result, the speed of oxidation of the silicon atoms are slow down, and eventually, the etching rate of \u30081 0 0\u3009 and \u30081 1 0\u3009 orientations are basically identical. Ultimately, the silicon atoms are etched at isotropic speeds. The action diagram is shown in Fig. 8 . When the additive was added to the solution in Step3b, the reaction speed can be slowed down in places with high reaction speed, such as Si \u30081 0 0\u3009, so that the etching speed of all crystallites is basically the same, and the whole reaction speed tends to average. Because of this, after adding the additive to the solution in Group-B, intensive nano-pores with basically the same depth are obtained for crystallites with different orientation, and the depths of the pore can be adjusted by the etching time and the size of Ag nanoparticles. Fig. 9 is a front SEM image of Si wafer etched with dense nano-pores. The silicon wafers, whose surface are covered with dense nano-pores, cannot be used directly to fabricate solar cells. Instead, a mixed solution containing HF, HNO3 and DIW must be used to modify these nanostructures, so that these nano-pores grew in diameter gradually and then swallow up the surrounding pores, finally turn into large-diameter pit-like nanostructures shown in Fig. 5. This process is shown in Fig. 7g\u2013j. In acid solution, acid only enlarges the diameter and depth of these nano-pores isotropically by the same amount (Barron, 2014). Therefore, for the silicon wafer treated in Step3a, the depth and size of the nano-pores on the surface of the crystallites with different orientations differ greatly as shown in Fig. 5a and b. While for the silicon wafer treated in Step3b no significant difference in the surface morphology can be observed on the crystallites with different orientations. Finally, nanostructures with basically the same size and depth can be uniformly achieved on crystallites with different orientation, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. As a result, the boundaries of the crystallites are very blurry as shown in Fig. 6b and d. The reflectivity curve and weighted average reflection of the samples treated in Step3a and Step3b and coated with a SiNx film by PECVE are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 1 respectively. It is obvious that, in the test wavelength range, the reflectivity curve of Group-A was always below that of Group-B, and the same phenomenon occurs after the Si wafer coating SiNx by PECVD. In terms of weighted average reflectivity, Group-A was 2 to 3 percentage points lower than Group-B. The low reflectivity of black Si can be explained by considering the refractive index (Yuan, 2009); and the effective medium theory (Chattopadhyay, 2010). When the silicon surface is etched with nanostructures, it seems to be coated with thin films with different refractive indices as shown in Fig. 11 . It can be seen from Eq. (6) that, under the condition of the same diameter, the deeper the depth of the nanostructure is, the slower the refractive index gradient will be, so the lower the reflectivity will be. (6) ( n 2 - n 1 2 ) ( n 2 + 2 n 1 2 ) = ( 1 - f 1 ) ( n 2 2 - n 1 2 ) ( n 2 2 + 2 n 1 2 ) where n1 and n2 are the refractive indexes of air and silicon in the effective layers, f1 is the corresponding volume fraction (Zhang and An, 2019). According to the effective medium theory, the reflectivity of the black silicon can be calculated based on the refractive index. And the calculated reflectivity of 18.4% was obtained, which is pretty close to R = 18.17% in this experiment. Because there is no additive in the Step3a, the depth of the nanostructure on the surface of the Group-A is deeper than that of Group-B, so the gradual change of the refractive index on the surface of Group-A is slower than that of Group-B, resulting in the higher reflectivity of the Group-B than that of Group-A. This result proves that the additive can indeed slow down the etching speed of Ag nanoparticles. Two-sided phosphorus diffusion was conducted on the black Si of Group-A and Group-B in the same diffusion furnace, and then carried out two-sided PSG removal for these wafers. Then PECVD was used to coat them with SiNx thin films of same thickness on both sides, and their effective minority carrier lifetime (\u03c4eff) mapping was measured by Semilab PV-2000. Although the size of the sample is 156 \u00d7 156 mm2, but the actual testing area is 140 \u00d7 140 mm2. Table 2 shows that the effective minority carrier lifetime and auger recombination rate of Group-A was nearly twice and a third of that of Group-B respectively. In order to obtain the emitter saturation current density of the final device, minority carrier lifetime was tested as a function of injection level using quasi-steady-state photo-conductance (QSSPC) by Sinton WCT-120. As shown in Fig. 12 , minority carrier lifetime at injection level 1E15/cm3 of Group-B was 80.56 \u03bcs, which was higher than that of Group-A (25.99 \u03bcs). Similar result was obtained when samples were tested by Semilab PV-2000A. Both of them proved that Group-B has better SiNx passivation quality than Group-A. Different lifetime tested by different methods (Semilab PV-2000 and Sinton WCT-120) was mentioned in other research, mainly originating from the different infection level and operating principle when testing (Sch\u00fcler, 2012). The reason for this phenomenon is that the depth of nano-pores on the surface of Group-A is deeper than that of Group-B, So the specific surface area of Group-A is larger than that of Group-B. So the surface recombination rate of Group-A is more serious than that of Group-B. Finally, the minority carrier lifetime of Group-A is lower than that of Group-B. These results suggest that the additive can indeed slow down the etching rate of the silicon wafers by Ag-MACE, so that the etching rate of crystallites with different orientation is the same, and thus the whole wafers is uniformly textured, and the boundary between grains becomes blurred. Finally, the black Si of Group-A and Group-B were made into solar cells by standard technology. Their photoelectric conversion efficiency, IV curve, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were tested, and the results were shown in Table 3 , Figs. 13 and 14 , respectively. As can be seen from Table 3, the efficiency, Voc and Isc of Group-B had been greatly improved. Because the nano-pores on the surface of Group-A was very deep without the effect of additives. As a result, the passivation of the coating is poor, which will lead to the severe surface recombination of the Group-A, so the open circuit voltage was reduced, and the efficiency was ultimately lower than that of Group-B. The above results can be further supported by both EQE and IQE of these two cells shown in Fig. 14. The Group-B had higher EQE and IQE values because of less surface recombination in comparison with Group-A. EL spectrum is often used to characterize the relationship between the potential recombination defects, the minority carrier diffusion length and the emission intensity. Obviously, many large black spots and dots can be seen from Fig. 15 a, while the whole cell in Fig. 15b is very bright, and almost no black spots can be seen. This was because the surface of Group-A was textured unevenly. This resulted in poor passivation of the Group-A\u2019s surface after coated with SiNx by PECVD. Thus, the surface recombination speed of Group-A was faster than that of Group-B. This also proved that the additive can indeed help to make uniform texturing structure on the crystallites with different orientations. 4 Conclusion In summary, an additive was developed to assist the texturing of silicon wafer by Ag-MACE. The etching speed of the crystallites with different orientation can be adjusted by the additives, so that the etching speed of \u30081 0 0\u3009 crystallite can be reduced to the same as that of crystallites with \u30081 1 0\u3009 orientation. In this way, nanostructures with little difference in size and depth were produced on crystallites with different orientations, so that uniform texturing structure was obtained on the surface of the multi-crystalline Si wafer. Finally, the performance of solar cells was improved in many aspects, such as surface morphology, photoelectric conversion efficiency, IQE, EQE and EL spectra. The maximum efficiency of 19.56% and average efficiency of 19.24% were obtained for the solar cells with additive, which were 0.65% and 0.64% absolutely higher than that of solar cells without additive.
