Graphical abstract The uniform distribution of silver nanoparticles on the surfaces of diamond-wire sawn multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) is critical for the texturing of mc-Si by the Ag metal-assisted chemical etching method (Ag-MACE). In this study, an additive containing alkylphenol polyoxyethylene is developed to improve the Ag-MACE process. It enables an even deposition of the silver nanoparticles over the surface of the silicon wafer, so that the entire wafer surface can be uniformly textured with nanostructures. The experimental results show that the additive improves the appearance and performance of solar cells, including their reflectivity, efficiency, internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency. Mass-produced mc-Si solar cells textured using Ag-MACE with this additive have achieved a maximum efficiency of 19.51%, compared with an efficiency of 19.16% for cells fabricated without the additive. Keywords Multicrystalline silicon Solar cell Diamond wire saw Metal-assisted chemical etching Uniform textures Additive 1 Introduction In recent years, the fabrication of multicrystalline black silicon (b-Si) has emerged as a hot technology in the photovoltaic industry [1\u201331]. Major manufacturers have built production lines for b-Si solar cells, and some have even built several gigawatts of b-Si solar cell production lines at the same time. In addition to the Ag-MACE process described in this paper, several other methods can be used to prepare b-Si, including dry reactive etching (RIE) [25,32], the femtosecond laser technique [33], and electrochemical etching, among others. However, only Ag-MACE can be used for the mass production of b-Si. However, there are still some problems to be solved when working with Ag-MACE. The equipment currently used to produce multicrystalline b-Si is a large, automated slot machine. The volume of a single tank can reach 400 L, and such machines can produce up to 500 pieces of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers at a time. One of the major problems with this equipment is the excessive discharge of wastewater because the wafers must be rinsed in a pure sink for several minutes after each process. Furthermore, the water in the tanks is discharged at irregular intervals. As a result, the production cost of b-Si is much higher than that of silicon wafers produced by the conventional acid texturing method. Another problem in the production of b-Si by Ag-MACE is the unaesthetic appearance of the b-Si wafers: a large color difference can be observed within a single b-Si wafer or between wafers, which is not acceptable to customers. Despite these problems, researchers are continuing to search for new methods to produce b-Si because the final efficiency of b-Si solar cells is more than 0.3% percentage points higher than that of conventional acid-textured solar cells [13]. This is due to the low reflectivity of b-Si wafers, which can reach a minimum of less than 1%. A prerequisite for the production of b-Si by Ag-MACE is the uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles over the whole silicon wafer. Prior to this experiment, our team had studied the use of additives to control the etching rates of silver nanoparticles in different crystal directions on multicrystalline silicon, with the aim of making these consistent [34]. In this work, an additive was used which promoted the uniform deposition of Ag nanoparticles and hence improved the Ag-MACE process. As a result, a uniform nanostructure can be prepared over the whole surface of the silicon wafer, and a batch of solar cells was fabricated with high values of efficiency (\u014b), average efficiency, average short circuit current (J sc), average open circuit voltage (V oc) and average fill factor (FF) of 19.51%, 19.20%, 37.64 mA/cm2, 636 mV and 80.20%, respectively, compared to those produced without using the additive (19.16%, 18.87%, 37.23 mA/cm2, 628.6 mV and 80.63%, respectively). The additive we have developed is therefore very useful in preparing highly efficient b-Si solar cells, and has good commercial prospects in the photovoltaic industry. 2 Experimental In this experiment, P-type DWS mc-Si wafers (156.75 \u00d7 156.75 mm2 square) were used. These have a resistivity of 1\u20133 \u03a9\u00b7cm, a minority carrier lifetime of 1\u20133 us and a thickness of 200 \u00b5m, and are referred to as bare Si. Table 1 gives detailed information about the fabrication of black silicon while Fig. 1 shows the experimental steps. The purpose of Step 1 is to remove the top layer of the bare Si (damaged by cutting) with a hot KOH solution. The wafers were then divided into two groups: one was treated as in Step 2A (HF, AgNO3, deionized water (DIW) and additive), referred to as the experimental group, while the other was treated as in Step 2B (HF, AgNO3, DIW without an additive), referred to as the control group. Nanopores are etched into the Si wafers via Step 3, and then enlarged into micron pits in Step 4. Finally, these wafers are desilvered and then dried to produce the final b-Si. The conditions are the same for both groups, except for the experimental conditions of Step 2. The b-Si wafers were then made into solar cells using the following standard processes: phosphorus diffusion to form a PNjunction; removal of PSG and edge etching; coating with SiNx by PECVD; screen printing and firing to form metal contacts. The surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S4800). The reflectance, external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) were measured by an IPCE solar cell system (Sofn, 7-SCSpec, China). The minority carrier lifetime and the surface lifetime mapping were measured by the quasi-steady-state photo-conductance method with a Sinton WCT-120 and Semilab PV-2000, respectively. The electrical performance of the resulting solar cells was studied using a current\u2013voltage (I-V) measurement system (under AM1.5G, R.T.). 3 Results and discussion In Step 2, when the silicon wafers are immersed in an aqueous solution of HF and AgNO3, a redox reaction occurs, producing Ag nanoparticles which are deposited on the surface of the wafers. (Because silver is more electronegative than silicon, the silver ions in the solution take electrons from the silicon and are reduced to silver nanoparticles). When the silicon wafers are immersed in the solution containing HF, H2O2 and DIW, many galvanic cells are formed due to the Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the silicon wafer (Fig. 2 ). The electrons in the silicon are transported to the surface of the silicon wafer through the Ag nanoparticles and combine with the holes and, as a result, the Si is oxidized to SiO2, which is etched by HF. As these reactions proceed, a pit is gradually formed beneath the Ag nanoparticles. The Ag nanoparticles then fall into the pits and eventually nanopores are formed on the surface of the Si wafers. Because galvanic cells can greatly speed up the chemical reaction, the areas with Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface can be etched quickly, producing many nanopores, while the areas without Ag nanoparticles have very few nanopores. In this work, the main component of the additive is alkylphenol polyoxyethylene ether, which is a macromolecular non-ionic surfactant. On the one hand, the surfactant has good dispersion in aqueous solution. Functional groups such as hydroxyl (\u2013OH) and amino (\u2013NH2) in the polymer adsorb to a certain extent on the silver ions, which promotes the dispersion of silver ions. On the other hand, the surfactant can also interact with the silicon surface, allowing the silver ions to deposit more evenly and to nucleate. Therefore the silver nanoparticles do not increase in size on the silicon, but rather settle evenly across the surface. In the etching solution, the surface of the silicon is etched with a uniform nanopore structure where the silver nanoparticles were deposited evenly. However, where no silver nanoparticles were deposited, almost no nanopore structure was produced and the original surface morphology of the silicon wafer was retained. When there was no additive in the solution, the Ag nanoparticles did not deposit evenly across the silicon wafer, some areas having large silver nanoparticles, while others had almost no Ag nanoparticles at all (Fig. 3 ). After Step 2, SEM images of the silicon wafers were recorded (Fig. 4 ). It can be seen that the Ag nanoparticles on silicon wafers treated with the additive are uniformly distributed on the wafer and have a similar particle size. In contrast, some areas of the silicon wafers without the additive have no silver nanoparticles, or only a few large Ag nanoparticles. After the Ag nanoparticles have been deposited on the silicon wafers, the silicon wafers are immersed in an aqueous solution containing HF and H2O2 to form nanopores on the silicon. Fig. 5 shows photographs of a silicon wafer after Step 3. It can be seen from Fig. 5a and b that the wafers in the experimental group (with additive) appear black, while for the control group, some areas, especially the edge zones, exhibit a bright appearance. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 5c and d that the overall texture of the wafers in the experimental group is uniform, while this is not the case for some areas of wafers in the control group, especially the edge areas. Fig. 5e and f show that the boundaries between crystallites in the circled areas in Fig. 5f are still obvious. Because these areas did not receive a uniform deposit of Ag nanoparticles, they are not etched with uniform micron structures, so they look like conventional mc-Si solar cells prepared by conventional acid etching. By contrast, the cells prepared with the additive in Step 2 exhibit a uniform and even appearance, with no boundaries between crystallites visible. It can be seen from Fig. 6 a1 and 6a2 that the area shown in Fig. 5a and the black area of Fig. 5b are covered with dense nanopores, while Fig. 6a3 shows that the bright area in Fig. 5b has only a few nanopores. The reason for this is that a large number of Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the black areas, while only a small number of Ag nanoparticles were deposited in the bright areas, which therefore showed less nanostructure. Fig. 6b1 and b2 show that both b-Si wafers from the experimental group and the uniformly textured area of b-Si from the control group are etched with evenly sized micron pits, while there are many places in the bright area of b-Si from the control group that are not etched with such pits. It can be seen from Fig. 6c3 that where there are no Ag nanoparticles, the nanostructure is very shallow, while Fig. 6c1 and c2 show that places with many Ag nanoparticles are etched with deep pit-like nanostructures, which are conducive to reducing the reflectivity of the silicon wafer [35]. The reflectivity curves and weighted average reflectance of the samples are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2 , respectively. It is obvious that, in the tested wavelength range, the reflectivity curve of samples from the experimental group is always below that of samples from the control group. The weighted average reflectivity after Step 3 processing of samples from the experimental group is 3.4% lower than that for the control group while the weighted average reflectivity of the final b-Si from the experimental group is 2.13% lower than that of the corresponding material from the control group. In addition, the reflectivity of all samples is much lower than that of bare Si. This could be partly due to the refractive index gradient as explained by the effective medium theory, and partly due to geometrical trapping [3,31]. The denser the nanopores, the slower the refractive index gradient and the lower the reflectivity. In addition, for the same diameter of the pit, the deeper the hole, the higher the probability of light reflecting twice or more times in it, and thus the lower the reflectivity [35]. Because the solution in Step 2B has no additives, the deposition of Ag nanoparticles is uneven, resulting in some areas without Ag nanoparticles. These regions are not etched and therefore have a higher reflectivity than other regions with a nanostructure formed through etching, so on the whole, the reflectivity of the control group samples is higher than that of the experimental group samples. These phenomena demonstrate that the additive allows Ag nanoparticles to be deposited more evenly across the surface of the silicon wafers. Two-sided phosphorus diffusion is conducted on the b-Si samples from the experimental group and the control group using the same diffusion furnace, and then two-sided PSG removal is carried out. SiNx thin films of the same thickness are then coated on both sides of the samples using PECVD. The effective minority carrier lifetime (\u03c4) map is shown in Fig. 8 and Table 3 . It should be noted that in this case the area tested is 140 \u00d7 140 mm2 rather than 156.75 \u00d7 156.75 mm2. Table 3 shows that the minority carrier lifetime of samples from the control group is almost twice as large as that of samples from the experimental group. Furthermore, the surface recombination rate of samples from the experimental group is much larger than that of samples from the control group. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the efficient region (purple and blue areas) of samples from the control group is significantly larger than that of samples from the experimental group. This means that the control group samples show a better passivation effect. The reason for this phenomenon is that samples from the experimental group are uniformly etched with nanostructure, while many areas of the control group samples are not etched because no Ag nanoparticles were deposited. As a result, the specific surface area of the control group samples is much smaller than that of the experimental group samples, so surface recombination in the experimental group is much more significant than that in the control group. Finally, the minority carrier lifetime of samples from the control group is larger than that of samples from the experimental group. The cell \u014b, IQE, EQE and IV curve (Fig. 9 ) were then studied. As can be seen from Table 4 , the values of J sc, V oc and \u014b of samples from the experimental group are significantly larger than the corresponding values for the control group. Because the additive helps Ag nanoparticles to deposit more evenly on the surface of the experimental group samples, uniform nanostructures are formed on the surface. These nanostructures effectively reduce the surface reflectivity of the experimental group samples, thereby increasing the utilization of light and allowing more photons to be converted into current. This results in an increase in the short circuit current density of the samples in the experimental group, and ultimately an improvement in the solar cell efficiency. The output of the solar cells can be further supported by comparing the EQE and IQE values of the two groups of solar cells (Fig. 10 ). The cells prepared using the additive exhibit higher EQE and IQE values because more incident light is converted into photogenerated carriers and collected by solar cells. Finally, mass-produced mc-Si solar cells textured by additive-assisted Ag-MACE achieved a maximum efficiency of 19.51%, which is higher than that of cells fabricated without the additive (19.16%). 4 Conclusion An additive has been developed to improve the Ag-MACE process. The experimental results show that when the additive is used, Ag nanoparticles of similar size are uniformly deposited over the whole surface of the mc-Si substrate, and consequently nano-textured b-Si is fabricated without bright edges and spots on the surface. Finally, the appearance and performance of the resulting mc-Si solar cells are markedly improved in many respects, including surface appearance, reflectance, photoelectric conversion efficiency, IQE, and EQE. In this work, the maximum and average efficiency of the solar cell are 19.51% and 19.20%, respectively, which are 0.35 and 0.33 percentage points higher than the efficiencies obtained without use of the additive.

In this study, an additive containing alkylphenol polyoxyethylene is developed to improve the Ag-MACE process. It enables an even deposition of the silver nanoparticles over the surface of the silicon wafer, so that the entire wafer surface can be uniformly textured with nanostructures. The experimental results show that the additive improves the appearance and performance of solar cells, including their reflectivity, efficiency, internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency. Mass-produced mc-Si solar cells textured using Ag-MACE with this additive have achieved a maximum efficiency of 19.51%, compared with an efficiency of 19.16% for cells fabricated without the additive.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2020-04-30", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal",
