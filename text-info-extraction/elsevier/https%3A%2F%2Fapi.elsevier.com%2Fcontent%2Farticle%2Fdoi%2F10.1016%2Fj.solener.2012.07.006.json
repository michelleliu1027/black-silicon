Optimized textured structure is one of the most important elements for high efficiency multicrystalline silicon solar cells. In this paper, in order to incorporate low reflectance nanostructures into conventional industrial solar cells, structures with aspect ratios of about 1:1 and average reflectance of 8.0% have been generated using plasma immersion ion implantation. A sheet resistance of 56.9\u03a9/sq has been obtained by adjusting the phosphorous diffusion conditions, while the thickness of the silicon nitride vary in 70\u201380nm by extending the deposition time by 100s. Under the conventional co-firing conditions, a solar cell with efficiency of 16.3% and short-circuit current density 34.23mA/cm2 has been fabricated. Keywords Plasma immersion ion implantation Nanostructures Multicrystalline silicon solar cells Electrical parameters 1 Introduction Multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells currently account for about 60% worldwide photovoltaic (PV) production due to the low cost (Goetzberger et al., 2003; Gangopadhyay et al., 2007; Poullikkas, 2010). However, the efficiency of the mc-Si is about 1\u20132% lower than that of the single crystalline cells. One of the most important reasons for this difference is the lack of an effective method to texture mc-Si. In industry, acid solution is always used to texture mc-Si to decrease surface reflection. However, the reflectance of acid textured wafer is still as high as 23%, which limits its applications for high-efficient solar cells (Cheng et al., 2011). In order to further reduce the reflectance, types of approaches have been used to produce \u201cblack silicon\u201d, such as metal-catalyzed etching (Koynov et al., 2006; Branz et al., 2009; Toor et al., 2011), femtosecond laser pulses (Her et al., 1998; Crouch et al., 2004; Baldacchini et al., 2006) and reactive ion etching (Jansen et al., 1996; Schnell et al., 2000; Macdonald et al., 2004; Yoo et al., 2006; Yoo, 2010). We previously demonstrated a 15.68%-efficient single crystalline solar cell based on plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) textured structures (Xia et al., 2011). These structures exhibit high aspect ratios of about 7:1 and low reflectance of 1.79%. However, the short-circuit current (Jsc ) of the cell is much lower than expected, indicating that there is a mismatch between these PIII textured structures and conventional fabrication process. In order to incorporate PIII textured structures into conventional fabrication techniques, a number of technical issues have to be faced and solved. Some of them are listed as follows. (1) The lowest reflection structures with high aspect ratios may not be suitable for solar cells due to high surface area. There is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination. (2) Phosphorus is easy to diffuse into nanostructured substrate under the same diffusion conditions and thereby, highly doped n+ emitter with high Auger recombination will be formed, which will result in a low Isc . (3) Under the same deposition conditions of silicon nitride (SiN x :H), the depths of passivation layers are always thinner than that of acid textured cells due to the enlarged surface area and thereby, resulting in a low open-circuit voltage (Voc ). (4) The deposited SiN x :H layer is always non-uniform due to the nanostructures, which will affect the uniformity of glass layer after co-firing. The thick areas of SiN x :H layer are always incompletely etched while the thin areas have been done, which will result in a high series resistance (Rs ) and a low fill factor (FF). In this paper, in order to balance the competition between absorption and surface recombination, optimized structures have been produced by adjusting PIII parameters. The surface morphology and reflectance will be investigated. The diffusion conditions has been adjusted to obtain the same sheet resistance for PIII textured silicon, while a comparable thickness of silicon nitride has been deposited by adjusting deposition conditions. The electrical parameters of the PIII textured solar cell will be investigated in detail. 2 Experimental P-type multicrystalline samples, with thickness of 200\u00b120\u03bcm, area of 156mm\u00d7156mm and resistivity of 1\u20133\u03a9cm, were used in the experiments. After a damage removal etching in 10% NaOH solution, part of the samples (group 1) were textured by PIII in SF6/O2 (SF6:O2 =3:1, by volume) gases, others (group 2) were performed in HF/HNO3/H2O (HF/HNO3/H2O=1:5:3, by volume) solutions at 9\u00b0C for 220s. After the texturing process, solar cells were fabricated by utilizing conventional fabrication techniques, i.e. phosphorous diffusion, phosphosilicate glass (PSG) removal, edge etching, SiN x :H deposition, metal printing & baking and co-firing. The diffusion and deposition conditions are different for group 1 and group 2. The diffusion temperature of group 1 was 10\u00b0C lower than group 2, while the deposition time of SiN x :H layer for group 2 was 800s, which was extended to 900s for group 1. The process sequence for the fabrication of solar cells was shown in Fig. 1 . Both the surface morphologies and the interfaces of SiN x :H\u2013Si and Ag\u2013Si were investigated by a scanning electron microscope. The surface reflectance was examined by a UV\u2013VIS\u2013NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere detector. The sheet resistance was tested by four point probe, while the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed on a quantum efficiency measurement system. The current\u2013voltage measurements were performed under AM 1.5 illumination conditions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Surface morphologies and reflectance The photographs of the PIII textured silicon and the acid textured samples are inserted in Fig. 2 . It can be found that the surface of the PIII textured silicon appears black, whereas that of the acid textured silicon shows gray. The different colors can be understood from the different surface reflectance, which have been tested in the wavelength range from 300 to 1100nm and are shown in Fig. 2. It is obvious that the surface reflectance of the PIII textured silicon is lower than that of the acid textured silicon among the whole monitored region. Average reflectance (Ra ) is defined as: (1) R a = \u222b 300 1100 R ( \u03bb ) N ( \u03bb ) d \u03bb \u222b 300 1100 N ( \u03bb ) d \u03bb Wherein R ( \u03bb ) is wavelength-dependent reflectance, N ( \u03bb ) is the solar flux under AM 1.5 standard conditions (Menna et al., 1995). By calculation, the Ra of the PIII textured surface is as low as 8.0%, while that of the acid textured silicon is 24.4%. This strong absorption is originated from the PIII textured structures. The top and cross-sectional views of the PIII textured silicon are shown in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. It can be found that inverted pyramid-like structures with diameters of \u223c200nm and depths of \u223c200nm have been generated on substrate surface. These nanostructures, with silicon fraction increasing smoothly as a function of the depth across the textured layer, behave as multi antireflective layers, thereby resulting in the low reflectance over a broad wavelength range (Ma et al., 2006). 3.2 Electrical parameters The electrical parameters of the PIII textured and acid textured are listed in Table 1 . It can be seen that the Voc of the PIII textured cell is 613mV, which is lower than that of acid textured silicon. This may be attributed to the poor passivation of SiN x :H. With a Jsc of 34.23mA/cm2 and a FF of 77.6%, the PIII textured cell yields an efficiency of 16.3%. In order to further investigate the characterization of the PIII textured cell, we monitor the interface of SiN x :H\u2013Si, the interface of Ag\u2013Si and EQE of the cells. 3.3 SiN x :H\u2013Si interface and Voc The passivation of PECVD SiN x :H layers can be achieved by surface and bulk passivation (Duerinckx and Szlufcik, 2002). Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the SiN x :H\u2013Si interfaces of the acid textured cell and the PIII textured cell. It can be found that a uniform SiN x :H layer with thickness of 78nm has been deposited on acid textured surface, while a non-uniform SiN x :H layer with thickness of 70\u201380nm has been deposited on nanostructured surface, indicating that the comparable thickness of SiN x :H layers have been deposited on PIII textured silicon and acid textured silicon by adjust deposition parameters. The uniformity of SiN x :H layer will partially influence the quality of passivation. On the other hand, the surface area of PIII textured silicon is larger than that of acid textured silicon, which should increase surface defect states and low the quality of passivation. Another reason for the low Voc is the ion damage layers introduced in PIII process (Zaidi et al., 2001; Kumaravelu et al., 2004), which will increase the defect states underneath the textured surface and cause degradation of Voc . 3.4 Ag\u2013Si interface and FF Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of the Ag\u2013Si interfaces after co-firing. It can be found that a uniform glass layer beset with medium-sized Ag particles has been formed between the acid textured emitter and Ag grid. This could help in achieving good quality ohmic contacts and high FF. On the other hand, we observe that a non-uniform glass layer has been achieved between the PIII textured emitter and Ag grid. The main reason for this non-uniform is that the SiN x :H layer at the top of the structures is easy to fire through, which will result in the thin glass layer and increase the saturation current and decrease the Rsh . At the bottom of the structures, the layer is difficult to fire through due to the surface tension of silver paste, which will result in the thick glass layer and increase the Rs . This high Rs of 3.1m\u03a9 together with the low Rsh of 7.7\u03a9 results in the low FF of 77.6%. 3.5 EQE and Jsc Fig. 6 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and reflectance curves of the PIII textured cell and acid textured cell. It can be found that the average reflectance of the PIII textured and acid textured surfaces with SiN x :H layer are 3.1% and 8.6%, respectively. Assuming that the transmission is zero, there is a relational expression between reflectance (R) and absorption (A): A =1\u2212R, so about 6.0% absolute incident light can be absorbed by the PIII textured cell. However, the Jsc of the acid textured cell is 33.24mA/cm2, which improves to 34.23mA/cm2 for PIII textured cell (a 2.6% gain). From Fig. 6 it can be found that the EQE of the PIII textured cell is lower than that of acid textured cell in the 300\u2013450nm wavelength regions, while the reflectance of the PIII textured cell is obviously lower than that of acid textured cell. It is clear that the enhanced absorption has not been translated into electrical current predominantly due to the surface recombination, which may be caused by the large surface area and \u201cdead layers\u201d due to a heavily doped Silicon. The doping concentration can be characterized by sheet resistance. The sheet resistance of the PIII textured silicon and acid textured silicon is 56.9\u03a9/sq and 57.8\u03a9/sq, respectively, indicating that the \u201cdead layers\u201d is not the reason for the large surface recombination. The surface damage also should account for the low EQE in this region. On the other hand, the EQE of the PIII textured cell is higher in the wavelength of 450\u2013840nm, indicating that more electrical current has been generated due to the enhanced absorption. 4 Conclusions The nanostructure textured surface with low aspect ratios of about 1:1 and low reflectance of 8.0% has been produced using plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). By decreasing the diffusion temperature and extending the deposition time, 70\u201380nm silicon nitride layer has been deposited on 56.9\u03a9/sq emitter. The solar cell based on the emitter yields an efficiency of 16.3% with a short-circuit current density of 34.23mA/cm2, which can be further improved by optimizing the deposition process and the co-firing process.
