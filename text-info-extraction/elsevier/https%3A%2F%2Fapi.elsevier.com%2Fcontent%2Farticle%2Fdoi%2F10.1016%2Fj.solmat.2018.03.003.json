School of Electrical Engineering, and State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an 710049 China In this paper, a high-throughput continuous, single-face texturing method was introduced into the fabrication process for industrial multicrystalline silicon solar cell production. With a patterned photoresist film as the mask for the wet etching, wafers without back protection were transported by rollers and only the masked face could contact the etching solution and be etched through the mask openings. The first etching results indicated that serious heat aggregation and poor wettability of the acid solution on the mask surface resulted in a seriously uneven and uncontrolled etching reaction. However, after applying a surfactant to the photoresist mask to improve the mask's hydrophility, a stable and uniform etching reaction could be achieved. A honeycomb-like textured surface with a pitch of 18\u202f\u00b5m was fabricated successfully. The etched pits had a nearly smooth spherical segment surface and a surface occupancy of 70%. This regular textured surface had a low in-plane average reflectivity of approximately 20% and greatly increased the carrier lifetime. Compared with multicrystalline silicon solar cells textured by conventional acid etching, the average efficiency increased from 18.31% to 18.57%. In addition, this texturing technique is expected to promote the application of diamond-wire cut multicrystalline silicon wafers in the future. Keywords Multicrystalline silicon solar cells Honeycomb-like textured surface Multicrystalline silicon texturization Masked wet etching High efficiency Single-face texturing 1 Introduction A high efficiency and low cost solar cell is highly desired by the photovoltaic industry. Recently, multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells have taken the largest market share because of their low cost and high productivity [1\u20133]. However, compared to monocrystalline silicon, mc-Si has a higher surface carrier recombination and higher surface reflectance, which leads to lower efficiency [4,5]. For industrial production of mc-Si solar cells, isotropic acid etching on the base of saw damage patterns which acts as a starting point for etching is the best common texturing process to reduce surface reflectance [6,7]. However, this technique is not yet effective enough for texturing high quality damage-less mc-Si wafers, such as diamond-wire cut wafers [8\u201310]. Therefore, to further improve the efficiency of mc-Si solar cells, it is necessary to develop new approaches to achieve a textured surface with low reflectance and good electrical properties. Several new techniques have been suggested to texture mc-Si, including diamond-wire sawn mc-Si solar cells, such as laser ablation [11,12], mechanical scribing [13], dry chemical etching [14], reactive-ion etching (RIE) [15,16], metal catalyzed wet etching [17\u201320], and masked dry [21\u201324] and wet [25\u201331] etching. In recent years, the concept \u201cblack Si\u201d with a very low surface reflectance often appears in the research of mc-Si solar cells [32\u201334]. RIE and metal catalyst wet chemical etching are 2 mainstream ways to fabricate black Si. However, RIE requires large-area vacuum devices, and metal nanoparticle-catalyzed etching cannot avoid problems of metal contamination [34]. Although a very low surface reflectance can be obtained, neither of those 2 processes can fabricate a strictly regular textured structure, and they lead to serious surface defects [32,33]. To remove the porous layer and improve the efficiency of solar cells, subsequent processes are required, which lead to increased reflectance [19,32]. Besides the black Si with a nanostructure surface, masked wet etching techniques were proposed more than a decade ago that used an inorganic film of SiO2 or SiNx as an etching mask to fabricate a honeycomb-like microstructure textured surface for Si solar cells [26\u201328]. That technique could achieve not only a low surface reflectance but also good electrical properties for both slurry and diamond-wire cut mc-Si solar cells, and attracted much attention. However, further application for industrial production is limited by its low throughput and complexity in the formation and patterning process of the etching mask [26\u201328]. Recently, as the large-area lithographic technique has developed, a soft mask based on photoresist film has been also applied to the texturization of mc-Si solar cells in the dry plasma etching process [22,23]. For the wet etching process, although the weak strength and adhesion of the resist film on the rough mc-Si surface are critical deficiencies, photoresist film masked wet etching is an attractive solution for texturing the mc-Si silicon solar cell due to its low cost, reduced damage, appropriate imaging resolution, and high throughput process [29\u201331]. We have previously described a new technique for texturing mc-Si solar cells by a masked wet etching process using a negative photoresist as a mask [31]. Normally, masked wet etching for Si wafers uses an immersion process in which the entire wafer is immersed in the etching solution [25\u201331]. We fabricated a honeycomb-like structure successfully by a batch immersion process. However, to avoid excessive etching in the immersion process, the rear surface of the mc-Si had to be protected by a resist or other film. Single-face etching is more suited to industrial production, because the protection and follow-up cleaning process can be omitted to reduce costs. In this paper, we describe a true single-face texturing process for mc-Si solar cells using a masked wet etching method. With optimized processing parameters, we fabricated a large-area, honeycomb-like, textured surface for mc-Si wafers. Compared to mc-Si solar cells textured by common acid etching, improvements in photocurrent and efficiency were clearly achieved. 2 Experimental details [31] 2.1 Fabrication of the photoresist mask The basic substrates used were slurry-cut, p-type, boron-doped 2\u20133\u202f\u03a9 mc-Si wafers of 180\u2013200\u202f\u00b5m thickness and 156\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f156\u202fmm area. The wafers were first processed to remove damaged layers and impurities. A negative photoresist film (Beijing Kempur, BN308) was formed on the front surface of the wafers by screen printing. Then a photoresist mask was fabricated using photolithography. Array of holes which uniformly spaced in a hexagonal layout was used as the mask pattern. A prebake and hard bake were used to improve the adhesion and strength of the resist mask. The best baking conditions were 100\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fmin for the prebake, and 130\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fmin for the hard bake. 2.2 Fabrication of honeycomb textured surface After the photolithography patterning process, the wafers were etched in a mixture of 68% nitric acid (HNO3) and 49% fluoric acid (HF) aqueous solution. In a batch immersion process, masked wafer was dipped in the etching solution and the rear surface was protected by the organic film. In this paper, a continuous, single-face masked texturing system in which masked mc-Si wafers are transported continuously through the etching solution on a roller array was introduced. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the single-face texturing process. Unlike the conventional industrial acid texturing process in which the entire wafer is below the liquid surface and both faces of the wafer are etched, in this process the height of the rollers ensures that the masked surface of the Si wafer just touches the etching solution, and the rear surface is exposed to the air. Two pinch rollers are used to prevent the wafers from drifting during the etching process. Only the front surfaces of the wafers are etched by the etching solution through the mask openings. In our process, the wafers were transported 800\u202fmm, and we adjusted the transport speed to achieve an appropriate etching time. After the etching process, to remove the residual photoresist the wafers passed through a chain sintering furnace with a peak temperature above 500\u202f\u00b0C. Then the textured wafers were cleaned in a standard process comprising alkali cleaning (NaOH), acid cleaning (HCl), and pure water rinsing, and then dried by an air knife. 2.3 Fabrication of solar cells Fig. 2 shows the solar cell fabrication process. Except the texturing process, the almost same conventional process steps were used for both solar cells textured by conventional acid etching and single-face masked wet etching process. The throughput of solar cell production depends on the rate of the photolithograph process, which in turn is limited by the exposure process. In our study, the exposure time of one piece of mc-Si wafer was approximately 0.5\u20130.8\u202fs, and transport time was 0.5\u202fs. Therefore, the highest throughput could reach approximately 2700 pieces per hour. 2.4 Measurement and evaluation During the etching process, a thermal imager (ARTCAM-320-THERMO) was used to monitor the wafer temperature which could indicate the rate of etching reaction or whether the etching occurred because it was an exothermic reaction. The surface morphology of the photoresist mask and the textured structure of the mc-Si wafers were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a 3D optical microscope (Zeta 20). A standard diffusion 8\u00b0 integration sphere spectroscopic-reflectometer (D8SR, Ridatech LLC, Shanghai) was used to measure the surface reflectivity in the wavelength range of 350\u20131050\u202fnm. The optical and sampling apertures of the reflectometer were 20\u202fmm and 25\u202fmm. The carrier lifetime was determined by the microwave photoconductivity decay method (Semilab \u03bc-PCD). In addition, the surface contact angle was analyzed by a contact angle meter (Data Physics DCA21). The solar cell performance measurement was made by a cell test and sorting system (Fortix FCTS-400, Korea). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Photoresist mask Two photomasks with the same pattern pitch of 18\u202f\u00b5m but with aperture diameters of 9\u202f\u00b5m (sample 1) and 8\u202f\u00b5m (sample 2) were used. 3D and SEM images of the etching mask are shown in Fig. 3. An aperture diameter of the etching mask was 8.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.18\u202f\u00b5m for sample 1 and 7.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.17\u202f\u00b5m for sample 2. Nearly uniform opening sizes (A) and a very uniform openings distribution of a 2D hexagonal arrangement for the two samples were obtained. The actual aperture should be slightly smaller due to the polymer swelling during the developing and fixing process. The aperture ratio (the ratio of the aperture diameter to the pitch) of the etching mask for sample 1 was approximately 0.5 and for 2 was 0.44. By comparing the contours in the 3D microscopy images (Fig. 3, middle) of the apertures and the non-perforated mask surface, the thickness of photoresist mask could be estimated at approximately 2.1\u202f\u00b5m for sample 1 (Fig. 3a) and 1.9\u202f\u00b5m for sample 2 (Fig. 3b). During the damaged layer and impurities removal process by the acid etching, the mc-Si wafers could also be pretextured to reduce the surface reflectance by adjusting the etching condition at the same time. Usually the original mc-Si wafer has a higher surface reflectivity than 33%. However, if before the formation of the photoresist mask the surface reflectance was too low, there should be a large surface fluctuation which may lead to serious variations in the thickness and pattern uniformity of the photoresist mask, and even affected the adhesion of the photoresist mask during the etching process [31]. For the pretextured Si wafers shown in Fig. 3, the surface reflectivity of 25\u201326% a little higher than the common textured mc-Si wafer was selected. In a batch immersion process, the photoresist mask must be greater than 4\u202f\u00b5m thick to ensure the mask has enough acid resistance [31]. In the single-face texturing process, to get greater infiltration of the acid solution into the mask openings, a thinner photoresist mask was used. It was expected that the photoresist mask would be more acid resistance because the etching solution contacted the wafer from only one side. The thickness decrease not only lowers costs but also improves the photolithography resolution. In this study, although there was some deviation, the mask thickness for all experiments was controlled at approximately 2\u202f\u00b5m. 3.2 Single-face texturing results We have previously reported that in the batch immersion process, the optimal etching conditions to fabricate a honeycomb-like surface structure were HNO3 (68%): HF (49%) =\u202f3:1 (v/v), and a temperature of 25\u202f\u00b0C [31]. However, if the same etching conditions were used in the single-face texturing process, the texturing completely failed. As shown in Fig. 4, the etching reaction was so violent and out of control that the photoresist mask was completely destroyed immediately and mc-Si wafer was almost well polished; the average reflectivity reached approximately 40%. For an isotropic acid etching condition, lowering both the temperature and the ratio of HF to HNO3 can buffer the etching reaction. Fig. 5 is thermal images of the wafer surface during the single-face etching process. Here, the wafer was stationary on the solution surface for observation, and the solution temperature was kept at 10\u202f\u00b0C and HNO3 (68%): HF (49%) =\u202f6:1 (v/v). It was found that after approximately 20\u202fs a reaction started at an edge of the wafer. And during a long etching time, the reaction occurred in only a small region alone the edge of the wafer even until the photoresist mask started to be damaged. As shown in Fig. 5, region B had an unetched structure where no etched pits were observed, but region A had an over-etched structure. Fig. 6 shows the percentage of un-etched area at different etching temperature until damage of the photoresist mask occurred. With a decrease in temperature, the un-etched area increased rapidly. We considered that the heat aggregated in the Si wafer due to poor heat dissipation might be the main reason for such a violent reaction as shown in Fig. 4. In the batch immersion process, the mc-Si wafer was fully surrounded by acid solution and the reaction heat could be carried away by the flow of the surrounding solution. However, in the single-face etching process heat dissipation was not effective because the entire rear surface of the wafer was exposed to the air: a poor heat conductor. Lowering the reaction rate is usually effective in preventing heat aggregation during the etching process. But as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, to decrease the etching temperature did slow down the reaction but resulted in a seriously inhomogeneous etching reaction. In no case was a regular textured surface obtained. In fact, under the etching conditions HNO3: HF=\u202f6:1 (v/v), with temperatures ranging from 5\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C, the etching solution should react discernibly with Si. And in the immersion process, although the textured structure was not good the entire surface of the wafer was etched [31]. Absence of etching might mean that the etching solution did not touch the Si surface through the mask openings. We hypothesized that it was difficult for the acid solution to contact the Si surface sufficiently through the photoresist mask when only the masked side of the wafer contacted the etching solution. When the mc-Si wafer was fully submerged in the acid solution, the acid could easily infiltrate every mask aperture because of the fluid pressures, independent of the surface conditions of the mask. However, when the mc-Si wafer moved on only the surface of the acid solution, the surface tension and wettability of the solution on the photoresist mask should have an important influence on the uniformity of acid infiltration into the mask apertures. In addition, Fig. 6 indicates that the un-etched area increases with a decrease of etching temperature, which suggests that the infiltration of acid solution into the mask openings was temperature or heat enhanced. Usually, surface wettability depends on surface energy, often referred as hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. Surface treatment is an important technique to improve interfacial properties; therefore, in this study, we compared two types of surfactants, AEO7 (Dow Chemicals, USA) and JA (Liaoyang Sanshui Chemicals, China) to try to improve the surface property of the photoresist mask before texturing. AEO7 was one component of alcohol ethoxylate, and JA was a compound composed of several linear alcohols and was slightly acidic. An aqueous solution of each surfactant with 0.4\u20131.0% concentration was sprayed onto the mask surface and remained for 10\u202fs, and then dried by an air knife. Table 1 shows the surface state of the photoresist film with and without surfactant treatments. It was confirmed that the photoresist film without surfactant treatment was hydrophobic because its contact angle was larger than 90\u00b0. After the surfactant treatment the contact angle decreased greatly and the resist film became hydrophilic. The surface of the photoresist film after JA treatment had a contact angle of 13\u00b0 and was more hydrophilic than after AEO7 treatment. Fig. 7 shows thermal images during the single-face etching process at 10\u202f\u00b0C after the photoresist mask was treated by the 0.4% JA surfactant. The etching reaction started from the wafer central region and developed to the surrounding uniformly. When the etching time was 30\u202fs, the temperature distribution was very uniform over almost the entire wafer surface, indicating a uniform start of etching reaction. And when the etching time increased to 50\u202fs, the stable etching reaction has already happened on the almost entire wafer. In contrast, without the surfactant (Fig. 6), although the etching conditions were the same, only approximately 20% of the wafer surface was etched. Here, the temperature in the center region of the wafer was higher than that around, which was reasonable because of the weaker heat dissipation in the center region. If the wafers moved on the solution surface, the temperature distribution should be more uniform. Table 1 also shows the approximate temperature range within which the entire surface could be etched stably. It was found that the more hydrophilic the photoresist mask was, the lower the etching temperature could be used for stable and uniform etching. Surfactant JA had a better improvement effect. When JA was used, the etching temperature could be as low as 5\u202f\u00b0C at which there was no unetched surface observed. On the other hand, when the temperature increased to 25\u202f\u00b0C, the etching rate was so high that the etching was difficult to control. Fig. 8 shows a typical normally etched and over etched surface structure of the mc-Si wafer at 10\u202f\u00b0C after 0.4% JA treatment by the continuous single-face masked etching process. It was found that the almost regular honeycomb like textured surface structure could be produced. The etched pits had a regular spherical segment shape. Therefore, we concluded that surface wettability of the photoresist mask was the crucial factor as to whether a regular textured structure could be fabricated in the single-face etching process. A photoresist film is one kind of organic material that is generally non-polarized or weakly polarized and hydrophobic. However, the etching solution was composed of an aqueous solution of strong acids, which had better affinity with a hydrophilic surface. After the surfactant treatment to improve the hydrophilicity of the photoresist mask, the etching solution wets the Si surface through the mask openings uniformly and sufficiently, a regular and uniform textured surface of mc-Si wafers was fabricated successfully. After surface treatment with the surfactant JA, stable etching could be achieved in a temperature range of 5\u201325\u202f\u00b0C by the continuous single-face etching process. Next, using JA to treat the surface of the photoresist mask, we further optimized the etching conditions and fabricated solar cells. 3.3 Process optimization 3.3.1 Size of etched pits and reflectivity Under a certain etching condition, we could change the size of etched pits by adjusting the transport speed. Fig. 9 shows the size of etched pits and surface reflectivity in the central region of the textured wafer at different transport speeds and different etching temperatures for sample 2, as well as at 10\u202f\u00b0C for sample 1. It was found that for each etching temperature the diameter of the etched pits (h) monotonically increased with a decrease in transport speed, but the depth of etched pits (d) did not correspondingly increase. For every etching temperature there was an optimal transport speed at which the h/d of etched pits reached the highest value, and also at which the reflectivity reached the minimum. At etching temperatures of 10\u202f\u00b0C, 14\u202f\u00b0C, and 18\u202f\u00b0C, the lowest average reflectivity for sample 2 was 19.7%, 19.6%, and 19.6% respectively. With a temperature increase, the reflectivity of the textured surface did not change markedly. Fig. 10 shows the typical textured surface structure for sample 1 (Fig. 10a) and sample 2 (Fig. 10b) when its corresponding reflectivity reached the lowest value by the single-face texturing process. And Table 2 gives statistics of the textured surface structure whose reflectivity reached the minimum. It was found that 2\u20133\u202f\u00b5m of un-etched region remained between 2 adjacent etched pits regardless of the mask aperture ratio when the h/d value reached the maximum and the reflectivity reached the minimum. That is, the maximum occupancy of etched pits was allowed to approximately 70%, otherwise the value of h/d would be further away from 0.5 and of course the surface reflectivity would increase. Here, surface occupancy of etched pits before their overlap could be estimated by 0.907d 2 /T 2 . 0.907 was the surface occupancy when etched pits distributed as 2D close-packed hexagonal structure, d was the average aperture diameter and T was the arrangement pitch of etched pits. As shown in Fig. 10c, the average aperture diameter increased from 15.8\u202f\u00b5m to 16.8\u202f\u00b5m but the depth decreased to 6.3\u202f\u00b5m. The occupancy of etched pits increases to 79% but h/d decreased from 0.46 to 0.37. In addition, the data shown in Fig. 9 also suggested the same results, in which the value of d in our tests was much less than 18\u202f\u00b5m in almost all cases. It was suggested that the photoresist mask failed when the attached mask area was reduced to approximately 2\u20133\u202f\u00b5m. We hypothesized that the mask began to be damaged or exfoliated either because the un-etched wafer area became too small to support the residual photoresist mask or because the acid solution infiltrated between the mask and the rough wafer surface. As shown in Fig. 3, the mc-Si wafer had micron-sized surface roughness. At the edge of some mask openings there were even gaps between the mask and the wafer, which might lead to percolation or infiltration of the etching solution between the mask and the Si wafer and weaken the blocking effect of the photoresist mask gradually during etching. However, compared with the batch immersion process, the continuous single-face etching process could produce larger values of h/d and occupancy of etched pits, so consequently a lower surface reflectivity could be achieved. And in the continuous single-face etching process a much thinner mask could be used, suggesting the photoresist film had a better acid resistance. In addition, as shown in Fig. 9 and Table 2, although a same pits occupancy of approximately 70% was obtained, sample 2 with a smaller mask aperture ratio had a larger h/d value and a lower surface reflectance than sample 1. If we further reduced the aperture ratio; that is, reduced the aperture diameter of the mask pattern, a higher h/d may be obtained, but the occupancy would not likely have increased to more than 70% because of the failure of the photoresist mask. In addition, smaller mask apertures require a higher-resolution photolithography process and a higher etching-mask acid resistance. Therefore, in this study the aperture ratio of 0.44 with a pattern pitch of 18\u202f\u00b5m was used to fabricate solar cells. The measured reflectivity of the textured surface was the weighted average of the reflectivities of the etched pits and the un-etched regions, which were dependent on the h/d value, the surface occupancy of etched pits, and the reflectivity of the Si wafer before etching. The higher the surface occupancy and the h/d were, the lower the reflectivity was. Especially, an increase in the h/d value could significantly lower the reflectivity of the etched pits and of course lower the average reflectivity of the textured surface [6,35]. In the ideal isotropic masked etching process, the h/d value should be 0.5, and d should be equal to the pattern pitch; that is, the occupancy of etched pits should be close to or greater than 90.7% of the hexagonal close-arrangement [36,37]. In that case, the calculated reflectivity could reach 15% for the Si wafers [35]. However, in our tests although the reflectivity of lower than 20% was obtained, that was still much higher than other reported masked texturing processes in which an inorganic film was used as etching mask [26\u201328]. It was indicated that when the photoresist film was used as the etching mask it was difficult to fabricate an ideal etched pit with a high surface occupancy. It is the obvious limitation of this masked texturing method using a photoresist etching mask. 3.3.2 In-plane reflectivity distribution Fig. 11 shows the in-plane reflectivity distribution at the different etching temperature and JA concentration. Here, a box chart of the reflectivity data in different regions of the textured surface is used to depict the data dispersion. In Section 3.3.1, we adjusted the transport speed according to the surface reflectivity in the central region of the wafer. The results indicated that the reflectivity of textured surface could be lower than 20%. However, it was found there was a large deviation between the reflectivity in the central region and other areas. As shown in Fig. 11, the in-plane average reflectivity (star symbols) was much higher than the reflectivity in the wafer center. Especially, at a 6\u202f\u00b0C etching temperature the in-plane reflectivity dispersion was much larger than at other temperatures. With the increase of the JA concentration, both the mean and the dispersion of the in-plane reflectivity decreased. At the 10\u202f\u00b0C etching temperature, the reflectivity dispersion and its average also decreased slightly with the JA concentration increase. But when the etching temperature increased to 14\u202f\u00b0C, the mean and dispersion of the in-plane reflectivity were almost independent of the JA concentration. There might be several reasons for this large dispersion of the in-plane reflectivity. For example, the inhomogeneity of the photoresist mask produced in the photolithographic process could lead to large reflectivity dispersion which was independent of the temperature and the surfactant concentration. And the inhomogeneity of the etching rate caused by the inhomogeneous temperature distribution during the etching process might be one important reason. Additionally, we considered that the non-uniformity of the in-plane reflectivity at low temperatures was partly caused by insufficient acid wettability on the photoresist mask. It was confirmed by the results shown in Fig. 11 that the increase in JA concentration had a greater effect for lower etching temperatures, since the wettability was temperature assistant. However, further increasing the JA concentration was not necessary, and too high a surfactant concentration would increase the difficulty of the cleaning and drying process because of water retention on the wafer surface. Although a higher etching temperature is more beneficial for the in-plane uniformity of the structure and reflectivity, for industrial production, a lower etching temperature is preferable for continuous production because the continuous single-face etching system is a half-open structure. It is necessary to restrain the solution volatility. As shown in Fig. 11, a JA concentration of 0.8% and an etching temperature of 10\u202f\u00b0C are reasonable choices for large-scale production. At that case, the in-plane average reflectivity of 20% could be achieved and the range of the in-plane reflectivity could approximately be controlled within 1%. 3.4 Solar cell results Two sets of solar cells, textured by the conventional etching process and by the continuous single-face masked etching process, were compared. To allow for quality variation in the mc-Si wafers, approximately 2000 pieces of wafer were used and measured in each set. The fabrication process of solar cells is shown in Fig. 2. Mc-Si wafers prepared for masked etching were pre-textured in the saw damage and texture etching step before photoresist film printing. The average reflectivity of such preprocessed mc-Si wafers was approximately 24\u201325%. Table 3 shows the process parameters for conventional and single-face masked texturing processes. Fig. 12 shows examples of textured structures. For the continuous single-face masked etching, a honeycomb-like textured surface (Fig. 12a) was fabricated. The etched pits had a regular spherical segment shape. And for the conventional acid etching, a worm-like textured surface (Fig. 12b) was fabricated. Fig. 13 shows the reflectivity spectrum of the textured mc-Si wafers before and after AR coating. The decrease of the textured surface reflectance by the single-face masked etching process was confirmed. Table 4 shows the statistical results of the electrical and optical parameters of two types of solar cells. Average reflectivities of 24.5% for conventional texturing and of 20% for single-face masked texturing were obtained. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique was used for the AR coating. For conventional textured solar cells, the deposition time is approximately780 s. After the AR coating, the average reflectivity was reduced from 24.5% to 5.1%; minimum reflectivity was at a wavelength of 634\u202fnm. Under the same deposition conditions although the average reflectivity was down to 4%, the reflectance spectrum of single-face textured solar cells shifted toward the short wavelengths; their minimum was at 578\u202fnm and the reflectivity at the longer wavelengths actually rose. Ellipsometer measurements showed that the thickness of the SiNx film was only approximately 78.6\u202fnm, which was less than the normal 86\u202fnm. It was found that if the deposition time of SiNx was increased by approximately 80\u202fs, a thickness of 86.1\u202fnm and a wavelength at minimum reflectivity of 632\u202fnm, almost the same, were obtained. It was considered a result of the larger surface area of Si wafers textured by the single-face masked etching process, which also benefited the absorption of incident light and the efficiency of the solar cell. As shown in Table 4, the electrical properties and light absorption of solar cells textured by continuous single-face masked etching were found to be clearly improved. Carrier lifetime was also enhanced when the masked etching process was used. The average reflectivity of solar cells decreased from 5.13% to 4.03%. The actual increase of short-circuit current was more than 1.34%, which was slightly larger than the increase of 1.16% in absorbed light. Compared with conventionally textured solar cells, the average efficiency of single-face masked etched sample increased 0.26%, from 18.31% to 18.57%; the highest efficiency was over 18.7%. Fig. 14 shows detailed statistical results of efficiency for the two types of solar cells. It was found that the percentage of single-face masked textured cells with higher efficiency clearly surpassed that of conventional cells. For the single-face masked textured solar cells, the occupancy of the solar cells with efficiency higher than 18.6% exceeded 38.0%. 4 Conclusions In this study, a continuous single-face texturing technique for industrial scale production of mc-Si solar cells was investigated. In this technique, Si wafers were transported by rollers moving on the surface of the etching solution and only one side of the wafers could contact the acid solution and be etched through the photoresist mask. In the single-face texturing process serious heat aggregation and poor wettability of the acid solution on the mask surface resulted in a seriously uneven and uncontrolled etching reaction. By using a surfactant to process the photoresist mask and improve the surface hydrophilicity of the photoresist mask, a stable etching process was achieved on the surface of mc-Si wafer. Within a temperature range of approximately 5\u201325\u202f\u00b0C, an almost uniform textured surface with a honeycomb-like structure was realized. The texturing process was optimized from several aspects for the industrial production. Although a higher etching temperature is more beneficial for the in-plane uniformity of the reflectivity, a lower etching temperature is preferable for restraining the solution volatility. The increase in the surfactant concentration had a greater effect to lower etching temperature. But too high a surfactant concentration would increase the difficulty of the cleaning and drying process because of water retention on the wafer surface. Moreover, a smaller aperture ratio was better for lowering the reflectivity of the textured surface, if with a high enough photolithographic resolution and a strong enough etching-mask acid resistance. According to the optimized results, surfactant JA with the concentration of 0.8%, an etching temperature of 10\u202f\u00b0C, and an aperture ratio of 0.44 with a pattern pitch of 18\u202f\u00b5m were used in this paper to fabricate solar cells. The in-plane average reflectivity of 20% was achieved and the range of the in-plane reflectivity was approximately controlled within 1%. Statistical results of the output characteristics of solar cells indicate that an average efficiency of 18.57% was achieved by the proposed process, which is higher than that of conventionally textured solar cells. Contributing to the increase in efficiency was increased light absorption and decreased surface defects due to the more uniform textured structure. Consequently, the new single-face texturing process reported in this paper was experimentally verified to be an effective technique for texturing mc-Si solar cells in large-scale production. Compared with the common batch immersion masked etching process in which wafers are submerged in the etching solution, this single-face texturing technique using a continuous chain system further cuts costs and enhances throughput, because no rear surface protection for Si wafer is required, and a thinner photoresist mask is used. Of course, there are some limits about this technique. When the photoresist film was used as the etching mask it was difficult to fabricate an ideal honeycomb textured surface due to a weak acid resistance of organic film. And the final surface reflectivity could not be as low as those in the case that the inorganic etching mask was used. However, compared with other texturing techniques such as RIE etching, laser drilling and metal nanoparticles catalyzed wet etching, it could be considered as a low-cost technique. The proposed technique should achieve an average efficiency enhancement of 0.2\u20130.3% for industrial mc-Si solar cells. Although the efficiency improvement was not substantial, this texturing technique is expected to be applied to diamond-wire-cut mc-Si wafers in the future.
