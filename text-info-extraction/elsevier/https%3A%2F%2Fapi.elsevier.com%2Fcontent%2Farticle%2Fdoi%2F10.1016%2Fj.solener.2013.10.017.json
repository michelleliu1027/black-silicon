Tel.: +86 10 82995805. Communicated by: Associate Editor Igor Tyukhov The electrode contact property of silicon nano-textured solar cell was investigated. An industrial feasible technique was introduced to enhance the electrode contact. The electrical performance of nano-textured cells with this contact enhancement was measured and compared with the ones without. The series resistance was reduced significantly from 1.5\u03a9 to 0.3\u03a9 and the short-circuit current was increased from 27mAcm\u22122 to 29mAcm\u22122. The cell efficiency was improved from 6% to 10%. These data indicate that the contact enhancement is effective. Keywords Silicon solar cell Nanostructures Electrode-contact 1 Introduction Silicon (Si) \u2013 nanostructure (NS) has attracted intensive attentions in solar cell application due to their ultra-low reflectance and excellent enhancement in light trapping (Oelhafen and Sch\u00fcler, 2005; Ben and Bessa\u00efs, 2010; Wu et al., 2009; Hochbaum et al., 2005; Ben et al., 2012; Hamilton, 1995). Appling the nano-textures to the silicon solar cell can dramatically reduce the optical reflection and transmission losses (Tsakalakos et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2013; Yae et al., 2006). Therefore, the silicon nanostructures exhibit a promising prospect in improving the performance of silicon solar cell. Ag-catalyzed chemical wet etching technique has been reported so far to produce vertical-aligned NS array with average reflectance less than 3% (Nositschka et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2005; Dou et al., 2013). This technique can fabricate NS array of large scale rapidly in room temperature and atmosphere. It is simple and low-cost, and promisingly suitable for industrial application. However, such nano-textured c-Si solar cell has not shown advantage in efficiency. One shortage that impacts the nano-textured cell\u2019s performance was believed as the poor front electrode contact (Li et al., 2011; Garnett and Yang, 2008). Since the nano-textured surface is highly fluctuated and the space size is very small, the electrode can only be printed on the tips of NS array. The contact area shrinkage increases the contact resistance. There were several reports concerning the electrode contact enhancement for nano-textured solar cell (Kumar et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Dou et al., 2012). The contact property was enhanced by different techniques: protected the contact area from etching (Kumar et al., 2011); heavy doping facilitated Ohmic-contact formation (Chen et al., 2011) or fulfilled the voids between electrode and nano-textured surface (Dou et al., 2012). After the enhancements, the cells performances were improved as expected. In this paper, a low-cost technique based on screen-printing and normal diffusion was demonstrated to enhance the electrode contact for nano-textured solar cell. The contact area was protected from etching and heavily doped. The series resistance (Rs ) of the cells was significantly reduced and short-circuit current (Jsc ) was improved. This technique is effective and also feasible in industrial fabrication. 2 Experimental details The 4in. p-type \u3008100\u3009 CZ wafers with resistivity of 1\u20135\u03a9/cm and thickness of 280\u03bcm were used in this work. All the wafers were well cleaned and then divided into three groups. Full-textured (FT) group: nanostructures were fabricated via Ag catalyzed chemical etching (HF (5.0M), and AgNO3 (0.02M) at 25\u00b0C for 10min). The wafers were fully nano-textured. Selective-textured A (ST-A) group: firstly etching-resist was screen-printed to protect the electrode region, and then the nanostructures were fabricated via Ag catalyzed chemical etching. After etching, the etching resists were removed. In this way, the electrode region was protected from etching. Selective-textured B (ST-B) group: wafers were diffused using liquid POCl3 to form N+ region firstly. Then screen-printed etching resists was prepared to protect the electrode region, and nanostructures were fabricated via Ag catalyzed etching. After etching, the etching resists were removed. In this way, the electrode region remained flat and also was heavily doped. Then all the wafers were normally diffused to form p\u2013n junctions. After the deposition of 80nm SiN x passivation layer via plasmon-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), the samples were cut off into cells with an area of 20\u00d720mm2. Then the back and front sides of each cell were screen printed with Al and Ag pastes to form Al-BSF and front electrode, in which front electrode Groups B and C were printed by align-screen-printing. The silver electrode was printed on the location reserved in advance. Finally, dried cells were co-fired in belt furnace for metallization. The schematic graphs of cells are depicted in Fig. 1 . For FT group cells (Fig. 1(a)), the surface was fully textured and the silver electrode was directly printed on the tips of silicon NS array. While for ST-A and -B group cells (Fig. 1(b) and (c)), the surface area for electrode was reserved as smooth and the silver paste contacted well. Especially, the electrode contact area of ST-B group cell (Fig. 1(c)) was heavily doped, which facilitated the Ohmic contact formation. The surface morphology of nano-textured solar cells was investigated via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in a HITACHI S4800 device, as Fig. 2 shows. And then, in order to verify the quality of the silver\u2013silicon contact, the electrical properties of the three groups\u2019 cells were measured. 3 Results and discussion For the full-textured nanostructures solar cells, the screen-printed front silver electrode lay on nano-arrays, according to Fig. 2. The diameter of silver particles of silver paste is about 1\u20135\u03bcm, while the width between silicon nano-wires is about 50\u2013200nm. Therefore, the screen-printed silver paste cannot be filled in the spaces. In this circumstance, only tips of nanowire contacts with the electrode and thus a lot of voids existed. Which means the contact area of silver electrode was significantly reduced. For the selective textured cells, the region for electrode was smooth. The silver electrode printed on the bulk silicon surface thus formed a better contact. Fig. 2(e) and (f) shows the optical images of full-textured and selective-textured NS solar cells. It can be seen that the electrode contact area of selective-textured cell is not etched, where polish silicon surface is reserved. More importantly, the other area is nano-textured and appeared as same black as the surface of full-textured one. This result indicates that the selective-textured cell improved the contact property and also maintained the ultra-low surface reflectance. The series resistances (Rs ) of the three groups were summarized in Table 1 . It clearly shows that the Rs of ST group is lower than FT group, and ST-B group exhibits the lowest Rs parameter. There are three causes that affect Rs in solar cell (Green, 1982): firstly, the movement of current through the emitter and base of the solar cell; secondly, the contact resistance between the metal electrode and the silicon; and thirdly the resistance of the top and rear metal electrodes. For the three groups here, the substrate and electrode material are all the same. Therefore the main difference is the silver\u2013silicon contact property. For the FT group the silver paste was screen-printed on the nano arrays. But for ST-A group, the silver paste was printed on the bulk silicon surface. As a result, the Rs parameters distributed at range of 1.3\u20132.1\u03a9 in FT group, which is obviously higher than 0.4\u20130.8\u03a9 of ST-A group. The data indicate that silver\u2013nano-Si contact is worse than silver\u2013c-Si contact. For ST-B groups, the silver electrode was contacted with heavily doped emitter region. Then the Rs parameters were reduced to around 0.3\u03a9. This result is mainly attributed to better Ohmic contact, which formed by the heavily doped silicon with silver electrode. (1) R s \u221d exp V D N d 1 / 2 According to formula (1) Nelson, 2003, where VD is the contact voltage, Nd is the doping concentration on the side of the silicon. Its noted that Rs is proportional to (Nd )\u22121/2. As the doping concentration of silicon increased, the series resistance can be effectively decreased. Therefore, for ST-B cells, the heavily doped emitter region facilitated the Ohmic contact formation. And the series resistance was reduced consequently. The short-circuit current density (Jsc ) parameter of the three groups was also shown in Table 1. The Jsc distributed at range of 26.3\u201327.1mAcm\u22122 in FT group, 26.9\u201328.5mAcm\u22122 in ST-A group, and 28.8\u201329.7mAcm\u22122 in ST-B group. This increment of Jsc was also attributed to the enhanced electrode contact property. In c-Si solar cells, the short circuit current density can be expressed using the formula: (2) J SC = R SH R SH + R S J The main impact of series resistance is reducing the fill factor, and high values may also reduce the short-circuit current. The Jsc of cells was related to the Rs parameters. In this work, the decrease in Rs was attributed to the enhanced electrode contact property of the solar cell. Since the electrode contact determines the light induced carriers\u2019 collection, better contact is beneficial to the cell\u2019s current. For FT cells, the silver was contacted with nano silicon. The smaller contact area limited the carriers\u2019 collection. Therefore the Jsc of FT cells is lower than that of ST cells. And for ST-B cells, the increased doping level of silicon emitter region narrowed the energy barrier at the silver\u2013silicon interface. This increased the carriers tunneling transport probability, according to the Ohmic contact theory (Sze, 1981). Therefore, the front silver electrode collected more light-induced carriers through the tunneling mechanism, and the Jsc of ST-B cells increased consequently. Table 1 and Fig. 3 show the performance of the three groups of solar cells. For FT and ST-A groups, the selective nano-texturing enhanced the electrode contact and decreased the Rs , which improved the FF of cell significantly from 41% to 58%. As a result, the efficiency of cells was improved from 6% to 9% on average. It confirms that the silver electrode contacted poorly with nano-textured surface. For the ST-B group cell, the heavily doped emitter helps the silver electrode formed a better Ohmic contact with silicon. This better contact improved the Jsc and FF of the cell. Therefore, the cell efficiency was improved from 9% to 10.2% on average. For all three groups, the open-circuit voltage (Voc ) parameter varied little. The open-circuit voltage (Voc ) depends on the saturation current (Id ) of the solar cell according to the formula: (3) V oc = k B T q ln 1 + I sc I d The saturation current is influenced by the recombination both in bulk and on surfaces (Fang et al., 2008; Tiedje et al., 1984). If better passivation method can be applied on such nanostructure-textured solar cells, the open-circuit voltage (Voc ) parameter will be improved and better performance achieved consequently. 4 Conclusions In summary, silicon nano-textured surface contacts poorly with screen-printed electro To enhance the contact property of nano-textured solar cell, the surface was selectively textured by using screen-printed etching resist. Also a double diffusion technique was used to form heavily doped region on contact area of solar cell. By using these enhancements, the series resistance was reduced significantly and short-circuit current was increased correspondingly. As a result, the efficiency of nano-textured solar cell was improved from 6.1% to 10.2% on average. This technique is effective and at the same time feasible for industrial application.
