The first step of preparing black silicon solar cells by Ag metal-assisted chemical etching method (Ag-MACE) is to remove the saw damage layer on the surface of diamond wire saw multi-crystalline silicon wafers. The usual way to do this is with a hot solution of KOH. However, the surface of silicon wafers processed in large quantities in this way will have many white spots and stains. These white spots and stains are the saw damage layer that have not been removed cleanly. They affect not only the appearance of the solar cells, but, most importantly, the subsequent uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles on the silicon wafers. An additive containing cyclodextrin and lignosulfonate has been developed in this work. This can remove effectively the saw damage layer and eliminate the white spots and stains on the surface of the silicon wafer. So as to improve the appearance of silicon wafer and make silver nanoparticles uniformly deposited on the surface of the whole silicon wafer. This additive has been proved to be very useful in improving solar cell efficiency, raising parallel resistance and reducing reverse leakage current and so on. Eventually, mass-produced solar cells made by Ag-MACE with this additive have a maximum efficiency of 19.49%, which is 0.46 percent absolutely higher than that without the additive. Keywords Multi-crystalline black silicon Saw damage layer Solar cell Diamond wire saw Metal-assisted chemical etching Additive 1 Introduction Solar photovoltaic power generation process is simple, no mechanical rotating parts, no fuel consumption, no emissions including greenhouse gases, no noise, no pollution (Chen and Hong, 2016; Dai, 2018; Jihun et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014; Mrazkova, 2018; Peng, 2006; Toor et al., 2015; Q. Wang, 2017; Wang, 2018; Y. Wang, 2017; Yu, 2013; Zhang, 2019; Zheng, 2017; Barron, 2018). Solar energy resources are widely distributed and inexhaustible. Therefore, compared with new generation technologies such as wind energy and biomass energy, photovoltaic power generation is a renewable energy generation technology with the most desirable characteristics of sustainable development (with the most abundant resources and the cleanest generation process). It is of great interest in lowering the materials and manufacturing costs of solar cell technology. Diamond wire saw (DWS) is a wafering technology that developed to replace the slurry wire saw (SWS). The advantage of DWS wafering technology is that the resulted wafer thickness is uniform and, most importantly, much lower fragment rate than that by SWS technology. Thus, DWS wafering technology exhibits very high throughput while lowering the usage of consumables such as slurry and wire. However, the surface of DWS silicon wafer is so smooth that the reflectivity is very high, as a result, conventional acid method is difficult to texture the surface of silicon wafer (Dai, 2018; Su, 2018; Zhang, 2019; Su, 2018; Wu, 2018). Ag-metal assisted chemical etching method (Ag-MACE) is developed to texture the surface of silicon wafer in recent years. Silicon wafer textured by Ag-MACE are called black silicon. Because it has a very low reflectivity, as low as 1% (Huang, 2011; Jiang, 2017; Li, 2020; Li and Bohn, 2000; Liu, 2015; Toor et al., 2015; Volk, 2015; Wang, 2017; Yuan, 2009; He et al., 2012; Sarneta et al., 2012). For DWS technology, the emeries are fixed to the diamond wire, and they cannot roll freely between the wafer and the wafer, as a result, the wafers are covered with stripe saw damage layer (Fig. 1 ). Because of the stripe saw damage layer, heterogeneous surface morphology is observed for the silicon wafer, as shown in Fig. 2 . And the defects are concentrated in the top of the stripe damage layer. The experimental results indicated that the stripe saw damage layer had a significant impact on the preparation of black silicon by influencing the deposition of silver nanoparticles on silicon wafer. It is necessary to remove completely the stripe saw damage layer from the silicon surface. Currently, the common method is etching in KOH solution at a high temperature. This method can remove the saw damage layer on the wafer, but the surface of the silicon wafers produced will have a lot of white spots (Papet, 2006). For Ag-MACE, how to remove completely the saw damage layer on the surface of the DWS multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) is critical for obtaining high quality black silicon and high efficiency mc-Si solar cells. The reaction process of Ag-MACE is shown in Fig. 3 . The wafers were first immersed in a solution of HF and AgNO3. Since the silver ions are more potential than the silicon atoms, REDOX reactions occur between them (Peng, 2006). The silver ions are reduced to silver nanoparticles and deposited on the surface of the silicon wafers. Because of the presence of silver nanoparticles on the silicon wafers, electrochemical reactions occur on the surface of the silicon wafers when immersed in a solution containing HF and H2O2 (Huang, 2011; Cao, 2015; Toor, 2016; Huang, 2010; Wang, 2015; Campbell and Green, 2001). The electrons in the silicon are transported from the surface of the silicon wafers to Ag nanoparticles and recombined by the holes. As a result, the Si is oxidized to SiO2 which is etched by HF. The mentioned reactions resulted a pit beneath the Ag nanoparticles. And the Ag nanoparticles then fall into the pits. Along with the reaction, the pits become deeper and deeper, and, eventually nano-pores are formed on the Si wafers. These are the basic principles of Ag-MACE. However, this reaction takes place on an ideal surface (assuming the surface is flat). In fact, there is a saw damage layer on the surface of the silicon wafers. This damage layer (as shown in Fig. 3) is not conducive to the uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the silicon wafers. Hot KOH solution is usually used in mass production line to remove the saw damage layer. The chemical reaction equation is shown in Eq. (1) (Zhang, 2019; Yang, 2017). The reaction produces large amounts of hydrogen, which forms bubbles cling to the surface of the wafers (Papet, 2006). These bubbles prevent the KOH from continuing to react with the silicon wafers, resulting in the incomplete removal of the saw damage layer in these areas. (1) Si + 2 O H - + H 2 O = Si O 3 2 - + 2 H 2 \u2191 Prior to this work, members of our group had done a lot of research on multi-crystalline black silicon, developing sever additives with different functions (Li, 2020a, 2020b). Each additive solves a specific process problem in production. It is the organic combination of these additives that make it possible to production high-quality black silicon. In this work, we develop an additive that will be more advanced in this approach. The influence of white spots on silicon wafers and the subsequent deposition of silver nanoparticles were studied. And, the influence of these white spots on the solar cell performance was analyzed. An environmentally friendly and cheap chemical additive was developed to assist in etching silicon wafers to remove the white spots. The chemical mechanism of the additive assisted reaction was analyzed. Finally, high quality black silicon was fabricated. The resulted black silicon solar cell showed a uniform appearance and exhibited an average efficiency (\u014b) of 19.15%. This is an improvement of 0.4 percentage points over normal solar cells without additives. And which makes this work meaningful to in improving the quality of solar cells and reduce the production cost. 2 Experimental The experiment was conducted using commercially available DWS mc-Si wafers (156.75 \u00d7 156.75 mm2). Its doping is P-type, with a thickness of 200 \u00b1 20 \u00b5m and resistivity of 1\u20133 \u03a9\u00b7cm. Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram of experimental process steps (labeled Step1 to Step9 in turn). In order to investigate the influence of saw damage layer on the performance of black silicon solar cells, experiments were designed. There were nine process steps included, and two group of samples were prepared. In one group, additive was adopted in Step 1 to remove the saw damage layer (labeled as Step1-A) and no additive was used in another group (labeled as Step1-B). Except for the first step, the process conditions for all other steps were kept constant. The samples processed in Step1-A is named the Additive Group, and samples processed in Step1-B is named the Control Group. The main purpose of Step1 is to remove the saw damage layer on the surface of bare Si. The Step2 is to deposit silver nanoparticles on the surface of the silicon wafer. Step3 is to etch nanostructures on the surface of the silicon processed in Step2. Then the silicon wafer is processed in Step4 to enlarge the nano-pores. It is important to note that these wafers must be treated by H2O2 and NH3\u00b7H2O solution after Step4 to remove the remaining silver nanoparticles on the wafer surface (Step5), especially from the nano-pores. The wafers must be soaked in running water for at least a minute after each process. The wafers are then dried in nitrogen-protected environment. At this point, the fabrication of black silicon wafers was finished. Thereafter, these black silicon wafers are then used to make solar cells in the following steps: phosphorus diffusion to form PN junction (Step6), PSG removing and edge etching (Step7), SiNx coating by PECVD (Step8), screen printing and firing to form metal contacts (Step9). The test equipment required for the experiment mainly includes the following: scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S4800), which is used to characterized the surface morphology of silicon wafer; Semilab PV-2000, for conducting the surface minority carrier lifetime mapping; lighted current\u2013voltage (I-V) measurement system (under AM1.5G, R. T.) for output performance of solar cells. 3 Results and discussion In the process of industrial production, hundreds of silicon wafers are immersed in a wet etching bench of several hundred liters at one time. Every silicon wafers parallel to another one. The space between them in wet etching bench is very small, only about a millimeter. When such a large number of silicon wafers simultaneously undergo a violent chemical reaction in the solution, the large number of bubbles generated instantaneously in such a narrow space cannot be expelled immediately. In this work, an additive is developed to solve the problem of hydrogen bubbles. The additive is mainly consisted by cyclodextrin and lignosulfonate, which are mixed in a certain proportion. Among them, cyclodextrin has the property of dehydrogenation, and it has a high affinity with the hydrogen formed in the reaction process. This reduces the probability of large bubbles formed during the reaction. Another substance is lignosulfonate, which can effectively reduce the viscosity of the solution and thus relieve the surface tension of the solution. It makes it easier for bubbles created during the reaction to detach from the surface of the silicon wafer. The combination of the two substances can make the bubbles released from the surface of the silicon wafer faster and more uniformly. Therefore, it can better remove mechanical impurities, fingerprints and other contaminated materials on the silicon wafer. The surface of silicon wafer treated with this additive presents a uniform positive pyramid structure. The surface structure is more favorable for the subsequent deposition of silver nanoparticles on the silicon wafer and thus, a uniform porous structure can be obtained on the silicon wafer surface. As can be seen from Fig. 5 , Additive Group of silicon wafers have a uniform and aesthetic appearance (Fig. 5(a)). Control Group, on the other hand, has lots of white spots and even some smudges on the surface of wafers (Fig. 5(b)). It can be seen that white spots are mainly located at the central part of the wafer, while little can be observed at the edge of the wafer. The reason can be explained by considering the generation and desorption of the hydrogen bubbles. During the chemical reaction, the bubbles generated close to the edge of wafers can be released quickly. On the contrary, there is less space in the central part of the wafers, and the bubbles created by chemical reactions cannot be released immediately. Thus, many of them stick to the silicon wafer, preventing the reaction between wafers and the solution, as a result, lots of white spots are formed on the surface of wafers. Fig. 6 (a) and Fig. 6(b) shows the SEM images of Additive Group and local area of Control Group without white spots, respectively. It can be seen that these areas are covered with uniform pyramidal structure. In contrast, Fig. 6(c) shows the SEM images of Control Group with white spots on the surface, and the stripe saw damage layer is still observed on the sample surface. Saw damage layer has great effect on the deposition of silver nanoparticles. Because the saw damage layer is filled with dense defects, these defects are higher in energy. This means that the more energetic the silicon atom, the less stable it is, the more likely it is to react with other substances. In our experiment, the deposition of silver nanoparticles is a REDOX reaction. On the surface of the silicon wafers, the more energetic the silicon atoms are, the easier it is to REDOX with the silver ions, which are reduced to silver nanoparticles. So in theory, silver nanoparticles are preferentially REDOX with high-energy silicon atoms and deposit on those high-energy silicon atoms. As shown in Fig. 7 , the silicon wafers used in the first and third rows are treated with additive, and their saw damage layers are removed cleanly. The wafers in the second and fourth rows, which are not treated with additives, have white spots on their surfaces. An obvious phenomenon is that the deposition of silver nanoparticles in the first and third rows is much more uniform than that in the second and fourth rows. In other words, silver nanoparticles are deposited inhomogeneously on the surface of the silicon wafers if the saw damage layer is not removed cleanly, regardless of the deposition time or the concentration of silver ions. This heterogeneity includes not only the distribution of silver nanoparticles, but also the size of silver nanoparticles. In each column, the concentration of silver ions is the same. The deposition time of the top two rows was 30 s, and that of the bottom two rows was 120 s. At the same concentration of silver ions, the inhomogeneity becomes more significant with the increase of deposition time. This is because the silver nanoparticles in the defect grow fast, and where there are no defects (i.e. the damaged layer is removed cleanly), the silver nanoparticles grow slowly. So over time, the silver nanoparticles at the defective area grow larger than those at the less defective sites. In every row, the concentration of silver ions is increased gradually. The same tendency can be obtained from the Fig. 7. Given the same deposition time, the higher the concentration of silver ions, the greater difference in the uniformity of the silver nanoparticles on the surface of the silicon wafers where the saw damage layer has not been cleanly removed. When the deposition time is 30 s, and the silver ion concentration is larger than 0.08 g/L, obvious difference can be observed for the deposited silver nanoparticles. When the deposition time is 120 s, the non-uniformity of deposited silver nanoparticles is more significant, even for the Ag+ concentration as low as 0.01 g/L. These results strongly prove that the saw damage layer on the surface of silicon wafers will seriously affect the uniformity of silver nanoparticles deposited on the surface of silicon wafer. Therefore, the additive we developed can remove the saw damage layer and be beneficial for the silver nanoparticles deposited uniformly on the surface of the silicon wafers. This is critical for the next step in the preparation of high quality black silicon. Fig. 8 shows the surface morphology of black silicon samples in Additive Group and Control Group, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a), with the assistant of additive, saw damage layer is completely removed and the fabricated nanopores are very uniform. On the contrary, there is still saw damage layer on the surface of the final black silicon wafer, as shown in Fig. 8(b). That is to say, the saw damage layer is not removed in Step 1, and it is difficult to remove it later. Because the deposition of silver nanoparticles is not uniform, the majority of silver nanoparticles are deposited in a small part of the high energy saw damage layer. Elsewhere, silver nanoparticles were deposited in small quantities and small volumes. Therefore, in the following electrochemical catalytic etching reaction, only those places where more and larger silver nanoparticles are deposited can be etched into nano-pore structure. The saw damage layer around the large silver nanoparticles, however, is preserved because there are no silver nanoparticles (inside the circle in Fig 0.8(b)). Effective minority carrier lifetime mapping is performed for black silicon samples which are fabricated by double-phosphorus diffusion, double-sided PSG removal and double-sided SiNx coating by PECVD. Although the size of the sample is 156.75 \u00d7 156.75 mm2, but the actual testing area is 140 \u00d7 140 mm2 Sch\u00fcler et al., 2012. The measured results are displayed in Fig. 9 and Table 1 . These defective saw damage layers are deadly recombination centers for solar cells. This conclusion can be verified by effective minority carrier lifetime mapping. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the central portion of the silicon wafer has a lower minority carrier lifetime, that is, the red areas in the figure. This corresponds to the white speckled area in Fig. 5(b). These saw damage layers that have not been removed cleanly will not be passivated effectively in the subsequent coating by PECVD. As a result, the minority carrier lifetime in these regions are lower than that elsewhere. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the distribution of minority carrier lifetime is just the opposite. The minority carrier lifetime in the central region is high, while the minority carrier lifetime in the marginal region is low. Table 1 is the statistics of the number of minority carrier lifetime distribution for the whole silicon wafers, and the obvious differences can also be seen here. The average effective minority carrier lifetime of the Additive Group was twice as high as that of the Control Group. This difference is mainly reflected in the surface recombination speed (Save) of silicon wafer. As shown in Eq. (2), \u03c4eff is the effective minority carrier life, that is \u03c4ave in the Table 1, and \u03c4bulk is the bulk minority carrier lifetime of the material. Generally speaking, given a material, the \u03c4bulk of the matrial will not change. S is the surface recombination velocity, that is, Save in the Table 1. W is the thickness of the silicon wafer. According to the Eq. (2), the higher the surface recombination velocity, the lower the effective minority carrier life. This is why the effective minority carrier lifetime of Control Group is much lower than that of Additive Group. (3.1) 1 \u03c4 eff = 1 \u03c4 bulk + 2 S W Electroluminescence (EL) image is measured for the two group of samples to further investigate the influence of residual saw damage layer. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), there are many dark areas in the EL image of the Control Group, and they are also concentrated in the center of the cell. These dark signals are consistent with the distribution of minority carrier lifetime of silicon wafer as well as those white spot mentioned above. Because the residual saw damage layer on the silicon wafer can lead to severe surface recombination, it can cause poor luminescence during EL testing. Whereas, the EL image of the Additive Group (Fig. 10(a)) is comparatively bright. Thus, the EL images in Fig. 10 demonstrate that the surface recombination rate of Additive Group is effectively lowered by completely removing the saw damage layer on the silicon wafer. The detailed electric performance parameters and the IV curves of the two group cells are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 11 respectively. Compared with the data in the Table 2, the Voc of the Additive Group (635.58 V) was 8 mV higher than that of the Control Group (628.19 V). The main reason for the lower Voc of Control Group is that the surface recombination of Control Group silicon wafer is more serious than that of Additive Grioup. The Rsh of the latter (49.45 \u03a9) is much lower than that of the former (383.05 \u03a9), which is too low for solar cells. The reason that the shunt resistance of Control Group is much smaller than that of Additive Group is that the leakage of Control Group is very serious. This can be verified from the battery\u2019 reverse leakage of battery parameters. The Irev1 and the Irev2 refer to the reverse leakage current of solar cells at different bias (Irev1 corresponds to a bias of \u221210 V and Irev2 corresponds to a bias of \u221212 V). The greater the reverse leakage current, the more serious the solar cell leakage, the worse the performance. For Irev1, the Control Group (0.24 mA) is 4.71 times the Additive Group (0.05 mA). And for Irev2, the former (0. 56 mA) is 7.04 times the later (0.08 mA). Because the saw damage layer of Control Group is not removed cleanly. On the one hand, the residual saw damage layer itself is a place with numerous defects, which will cause serious surface recombination, which will lead to serious leakage. On the other hand, the residual saw damage layer can lead to heterogeneous deposition of silver nanoparticles. This will cause the heterogeneous textring of the silicon wafer. the heterogeneous texturing will seriously affect the phosphorus diffusion effect, the passivation effect of the SiNx film and the surface recombination of the solar cells. Finally, the average efficiency of the solar cells in Additive Group (19.15%) was 0.4% absolutely higher than that of Control Group (18.75%). For maximum efficiency, the former (19.46%) is 0.46% absolutely higher than the latter (19.03%). Those results undoutedly suggest the developed additive is very useful for fabricating high efficiency black silicon solar cells. 4 Conclusion During the mass production of black silicon solar cells, it is found that the saw damage layer on the surface of DWS mc-Si wafer cannot be removed completely due to the hydrogen bubbles. The residual saw damage layer not only affects the uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles but also leads to high surface recombination rate of the cell devices. In this work, an additive is developed to assist the release of hydrogen bubbles. The experimental results show that with the assist of additive, saw damage layer can be removed completely, and high quality black silicon can be fabricated subsequently. The achieved black silicon exhibited higher carrier lifetime than that of samples without using additive, and finally, high performance black silicon solar cells are prepared on large area mc-Si wafers, with highest efficiency of 19.49% and average efficiency of 19.15%. The results suggest that the additive developed in this work is beneficial to fabricate high efficiency black silicon solar cells in mass production.

The usual way to do this is with a hot solution of KOH. However, the surface of silicon wafers processed in large quantities in this way will have many white spots and stains. These white spots and stains are the saw damage layer that have not been removed cleanly. They affect not only the appearance of the solar cells, but, most importantly, the subsequent uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles on the silicon wafers. An additive containing cyclodextrin and lignosulfonate has been developed in this work. This can remove effectively the saw damage layer and eliminate the white spots and stains on the surface of the silicon wafer. So as to improve the appearance of silicon wafer and make silver nanoparticles uniformly deposited on the surface of the whole silicon wafer. This additive has been proved to be very useful in improving solar cell efficiency, raising parallel resistance and reducing reverse leakage current and so on. Eventually, mass-produced solar cells made by Ag-MACE with this additive have a maximum efficiency of 19.49%, which is 0.46 percent absolutely higher than that without the additive.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2020-07-01", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X20303182", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Li, Xinpu"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tao, Ke"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ge, Huayun"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Danni"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gao, Zhibo"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jia, Rui"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chen, Shengdi"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ji, Zhuoyu"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jin, Zhi"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Xinyu"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X20303182"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X20303182"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0038-092X(20)30318-2", "prism:volume": "204", "prism:publisher": "International Solar Energy Society.
