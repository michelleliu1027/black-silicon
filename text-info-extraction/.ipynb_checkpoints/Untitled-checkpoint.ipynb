       "  ' table 2 summarizes the average photovoltaic parameter values of solar cells with different a f/a proj. notably, the j sc of npp cells was enhanced by npp textures due to the excellent broadband spectral response. however, the relationship of j sc and a f/a proj is nonlinearly correlated due to factors such as poly-si parasitic absorption and front-side ag/al grid shadowing. among them, the npp cells with a f/a proj of 4.51 exhibit the maximum j sc of 41.12 ma/cm2, which is 0.56 ma/cm2 above conventional micron-pyramid cells (j sc ∼ 40.55 ma/cm2). meanwhile, the stacked al2o3/sinx films with brilliant passivation quality effectively suppress the surface recombination arising from high a f/a proj, which improve the electrical loss caused by the reduction of v oc. the v oc of npp cells with a f/a proj less than or equal to 4.51 is greater than 689.2 mv, narrowing the gap within 2 mv than that of conventional cells (v oc ∼ 691.4 mv). in this situation, the j sc gain of npp texture overcomes its appendant electrical loss, resulting in higher pce than conventional cells. ultimately, the npp cells with a f/a proj of 4.51 show the largest average j sc of 41.12 ma/cm2, superior average v oc of 689.2 mv, and highest average pce of 23.08%. a champion npp cell, with the pce of 23.24% and j sc of 41.17 ma/cm2, was obtained on 158.75 × 158.75 mm2 '],\n",

(2012) showed that the nanostructures worsens the auger and surface recombination channels by altering the doping profile and increasing the surface area, respectively. as sample a was made using the shortest reaction time in the dre process, it had the smallest bowl-like nanopores on the surface (fig. 4), therefore, the dead layer is the thickest and the doping concentration is the highest (1.67\\u202f×\\u202f1020 atoms/cm3) in a (fig. 7 and table 1), which is expected as the thick dead layer and high doping concentration indicate stronger auger recombination processes in a than in the two other group samples. 3.3 ',\n",

[21] and compare well to those shown by savin et al. [10], despite the difference in substrate type, dopant concentration and thickness. it is also evident that corona charge concentration on the top of the films is not as high in density as that estimated using cv after post deposition anneal. this can be due to the high leakage current measured using cv. it is also noted that outstanding passivation of flat silicon surfaces has been previously achieved by richter [39], werner [41] and hoex [25], with srv<1.5cm/s, yet the ald alumina in this work has been specially optimised to provide good conformity of the high aspect ratio nanostructures. an activation anneal, however, has proven advantageous for effective passivation. 5 ',\n",
       "  ' table 2 and the device models used follow those described in [43]. the simulated current-voltage results are shown in fig. 9. it can be seen that as θ increases, the change in jsc for the hybrid case is lower than that of nwa and pyramidal surfaces. this translates to an efficiency change from low θ to high θ of 14%, 5% and 1% for pyramidal, nwa and hybrid surfaces respectively. the device modelling illustrates that the ability to retain low reflectivity at high θ can indeed prevent a significant reduction in efficiency. the low voc observed, particularly for the pyramidal surface, shows that further improvement of the passivation is needed for the front surface j0. to explore the potential performance of the hybrid surface on an ibc cell further, fig. 10a illustrates the efficiency as a function of front surface j0. the results show that reducing front surface j0 down to 10 fa cm−2 can lead to efficiencies exceeding 23%. to relate this against current technology used to reduce reflections on solar cells, the results are compared against a pyramidal surface with an optimised antireflective coating (arc) stack of 80nm siox and 70nm sinx (carrier generation profile taken from opal2). a front surface j0 of 10 fa cm−2 '],\n",

       "  ' table 1 shows the surface state of the photoresist film with and without surfactant treatments. it was confirmed that the photoresist film without surfactant treatment was hydrophobic because its contact angle was larger than 90°. after the surfactant treatment the contact angle decreased greatly and the resist film became hydrophilic. the surface of the photoresist film after ja treatment had a contact angle of 13° and was more hydrophilic than after aeo7 treatment. fig. 7 shows thermal images during the single-face etching process at 10\\u202f°c after the photoresist mask was treated by the 0.4% ja surfactant. the etching reaction started from the wafer central region and developed to the surrounding uniformly. when the etching time was 30\\u202fs, the temperature distribution was very uniform over almost the entire wafer surface, indicating a uniform start of etching reaction. and when the etching time increased to 50\\u202fs, the stable etching reaction has already happened on the almost entire wafer. in contrast, without the surfactant (fig. 6), although the etching conditions were the same, only approximately 20% of the wafer surface was etched. here, the temperature in the center region of the wafer was higher than that around, which was reasonable because of the weaker heat dissipation in the center region. if the wafers moved on the solution surface, the temperature distribution should be more uniform. table 1 ',\n",
       "  ' table 2 gives statistics of the textured surface structure whose reflectivity reached the minimum. it was found that 2–3\\u202fµm of un-etched region remained between 2 adjacent etched pits regardless of the mask aperture ratio when the h/d value reached the maximum and the reflectivity reached the minimum. that is, the maximum occupancy of etched pits was allowed to approximately 70%, otherwise the value of h/d would be further away from 0.5 and of course the surface reflectivity would increase. here, surface occupancy of etched pits before their overlap could be estimated by 0.907d 2 /t 2 . 0.907 was the surface occupancy when etched pits distributed as 2d close-packed hexagonal structure, d was the average aperture diameter and t was the arrangement pitch of etched pits. as shown in fig. 10c, the average aperture diameter increased from 15.8\\u202fµm to 16.8\\u202fµm but the depth decreased to 6.3\\u202fµm. the occupancy of etched pits increases to 79% but h/d decreased from 0.46 to 0.37. in addition, the data shown in fig. 9 ',\n",
       "  ' table 2, although a same pits occupancy of approximately 70% was obtained, sample 2 with a smaller mask aperture ratio had a larger h/d value and a lower surface reflectance than sample 1. if we further reduced the aperture ratio; that is, reduced the aperture diameter of the mask pattern, a higher h/d may be obtained, but the occupancy would not likely have increased to more than 70% because of the failure of the photoresist mask. in addition, smaller mask apertures require a higher-resolution photolithography process and a higher etching-mask acid resistance. therefore, in this study the aperture ratio of 0.44 ',\n",
       "  ' table 3 shows the process parameters for conventional and single-face masked texturing processes. fig. 12 shows examples of textured structures. for the continuous single-face masked etching, a honeycomb-like textured surface (fig. 12a) was fabricated. the etched pits had a regular spherical segment shape. and for the conventional acid etching, a worm-like textured surface (fig. 12b) was fabricated. fig. 13 shows the reflectivity spectrum of the textured mc-si wafers before and after ar coating. the decrease of the textured surface reflectance by the single-face masked etching process was confirmed. table 4 shows the statistical results of the electrical and optical parameters of two types of solar cells. average reflectivities of 24.5% for conventional texturing and of 20% for single-face masked texturing were obtained. plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (pecvd) technique was used for the ar coating. for conventional textured solar cells, the deposition time is approximately780 ',\n",
       "  ' table 4, the electrical properties and light absorption of solar cells textured by continuous single-face masked etching were found to be clearly improved. carrier lifetime was also enhanced when the masked etching process was used. the average reflectivity of solar cells decreased from 5.13% to 4.03%. the actual increase of short-circuit current was more than 1.34%, which was slightly larger than the increase of 1.16% in absorbed light. compared with conventionally textured solar cells, the average efficiency of single-face masked etched sample increased 0.26%, from 18.31% to 18.57%; the highest efficiency was over 18.7%. fig. 14 shows detailed statistical results of efficiency for the two types of solar cells. it was found that the percentage of single-face masked textured cells with higher efficiency clearly surpassed that of conventional cells. for the single-face masked textured solar cells, the occupancy of the solar cells with efficiency higher than 18.6% exceeded 38.0%. 4 '],\n",

optimized for fabricating nanoscopic silicon based solar cells using design of experiments (doe) technique. the optimum nano-structure silicon substrate had been etched for 180s and had porosity of 25%, depth of 0.34\\u202fμm and diameter of 99.8\\u202fnm. modeling and experimental design were implemented by d-optimal design of experiment with 12 random experiments. the temperature and time parameters were varied at ranges of 810–910\\u202f°c and 15–60\\u202fmin, respectively. the result indicated that the diffused substrate at temperature of 840\\u202f°c and time of 60\\u202fmin had the highest voltage and current-density which were 0.607\\u202fv and 24.32\\u202fma/cm2, respectively. the reflectance of fabricated optimum solar cell was gaged. the result presented that the reflectance of black silicon solar cell had been 600 times less than the non-porous solar cells using sinx coated polished surface as antireflection layer. in addition, considerable gains of 13.64% on average efficiency, 0.53 on fill factor, 0.611\\u202fv on open circuit voltage and 43.43\\u202fma/cm2 on current-density were achieved for optimum black silicon solar cell. keywords porous silicon solar cell metal-assisted chemical etching phosphorous diffusion design of experiment d-optimal method 1 introduction solar cell technology is suitable for exploiting the energy from sun that is considered as the energy storage competitive with fossils. specially, solar cell research assays to increase the power conversion efficiency [1–4]. over 95% of all manufactured solar cells are combined by silicon and silicon-based solar cell market dominate on photovoltaic devices. the main reason for domination of silicon solar cells in world market is high quality silicon which fabricated in large quantities for microelectronic devices and its process does not burden any toxic material to the environment [5]. diffusion process in silicon solar cells are traditionally performed using phosphorous oxychloride (pocl3) and phosphoric acid in a tube furnace. due to its low toxicity and use of abundant materials and low cost, silicon solar cells hold in world photovoltaic market. therefore many efforts have been developed an affordable phosphorous diffusion process because the emitter structure engineering for silicon solar cells can be strongly influenced on the emitter structure quality of solar cells and conversion efficiency of solar cells [6,7]. however, the environmental issues such as toxic byproducts exist in furnace exhaust and the prolonged heat-treatment are factors that affect the cost and efficiency of pocl3 diffusion system. in order to meet the commercial photovoltaic requirements, the various factors such as low cost, high efficiency production and high quality diffusion process have been advanced. among phosphorous diffusion techniques, the cold spray diffusion as simple, high efficiency and low cost technique have been taken [8–11]. in addition, manufacturing the impressive nanoscopic silicon based solar cells is a fundamental requirement to get higher and broader spectral photo-responses across the spectrum of the solar irradiation range. the formation of emitter on porous structure not only play role in reducing surface carrier recombination velocity but also, it acts as anti-reflection (ar) layers reducing the light-reflection losses. therefore, porous structured emitter has been intensively provided single design for silicon solar cells to amend the conversion efficiency. nanostructures are the potential candidates due to their light harvesting properties over a wide spectral range (250–2500\\u202fnm), attending intense attention for solar cells [12], hierarchical structures [13–15], photodetectors [16,17], and porous structures as the surface texturization [18–20]. porous layers as photoluminescence layers can be able to absorb the short wavelength photons and emit the radiations in rather longer wavelength range that can be absorbed deeper in cells which could be collected more effectively. front emitter transparent is shifted to the incident short wavelength radiations by pl layers as down shifter and result in development the spectral response of cell in the region [21,22]. porous structures bestow eligible possible for application in photovoltaic devices because of incredible characteristics of nanoscopic black silicon such as high surface-to-volume ratios, adjusted energy band gap, high photoconductivity, photo-absorption across the solar irradiation range and passivating surface without any antireflection, [23]. various procedures such as reactive-ion etching, laser-induced etching, electro-chemical etching and metal-assisted chemical etching have been designed for constructing porous structures. to fabricate nanoscopic silicon, several methods such as reactive-ion etching and laser-induced etching as expensive, uneven and sophisticated methods for nanostructure fabrication have been commonly applied. in recent years, metal-assisted chemical etching (mace) which is concluded a noble metal (such as ag, au, cu and etc.) in an aqueous solution based on hf and an oxidation agent, has attracted incredible attention in fields of photovoltaic, optoelectronic and electronic devices due to it is a simple, cost-effective, controllable and high-throughput method for fabricating nanoscopic silicon [24]. however extensive and significant studies have been done on the applications of porous nanoscopic silicon structures in the field of photovoltaics, the benefits of design of experiment as a potent and efficient tool for engineering the diffusion process and formation of n+- junction on a p-porous rugged silicon substrate in experimental studies have not been reported yet. since characterization of theoretical data is important in experimental surveys, adaption of modeling and results of experiments is significantly considered. design of experiment is an effective tool for maximizing the amount of information gained from a study while minimizing the amount of data to be collected [25]. in addition, it is a structured and organized way of conducting and analyzing controlled tests to evaluate the factors that affect a response variable. the tabulated classical designs such as full factorial designs, fractional factorial designs, latin square designs, box-behnken designs and etc. do not incorporate user constraints. prasad et al. described the application of six sigma define–measure–analyze–improve–control methodology for throughput improvement of the phosphorus doping process. the optimized algorithm had been implemented in the production and it was running successfully [26]. as a result of this project, an effective gain of 0.9\\u202fmw was reported per annum. among optimal design soups (d-a-g-v-optimal) the d-optimal design is better than others because of its significant efficiency about search algorithm. the d-optimal design is applied for minimizing the generalized variance of the parameter estimators [27]. achieving a clear understanding of diffusion process on p-porous silicon substrates through modeling is a principal step towards optimal utilization of its advantages. therefore, d-optimal design of experiment has applied in this investigation to engineer the phosphorous diffusion process on porous heterogeneous silicon substrates by changing main factors (time and temperature) which affect the structure of silicon solar cells. essentially, this study is based on the engineering of n+ ps/p junctions in nanoscopic silicon substrates to use the optimum structure in photovoltaic application. based on the best of the authors knowledge the rare investigations have been done on the adaption of modeling and experiment results about diffusion process in nanoscopic structures. in this study, the d-optimal design of experiment is used for improving efficiency of investigated design to cover our constraint range of parameters. 2 experimental 2.1 preparation and optimization of porous silicon p-type mono-crystalline si(100) wafers (resistivity 5–10\\u202fω\\u202fcm, thickness 640 ± 10\\u202fμm) were used in this investigation. the area of wafers was the size of 1.50 × 1.50\\u202fcm2. in initial step, the surfaces of wafers were pre-texturized by 30% koh (merck) for 2\\u202fmin\\u202fat 70–80\\u202f°c. then wafers were cleaned in a mixture of 2.3\\u202fml hf (merck, 40%) and 2.2\\u202fml hcl (merck, 35%) at room temperature for 10\\u202fmin and rinsed by deionized (di) water. the mace method was used for fabrication of nanoscopic silicon as pictured in fig. 1 a. ag nanoparticles were deposited via an electroless method dipping samples in an aqueous solution including 1.3\\u202fml hf and 0.0085\\u202fg agno3 at room temperature for 90s. three different nanoscopic silicon fabricated by etching silicon in three different times (90, 180 and 270s). the samples were weighted before (m1) and after etching (m2) and mass loss calculated. to make uniform porous layers, the samples were dipped in a 0.5\\u202fwt% koh solution. finally, the samples were dipped in a diluted hno3 (merck, 65%) solution for 10\\u202fmin to remove ag nanoparticles and rinsed by di water. again after drying in last step, the samples were weighted (m3) and the following eq. (3). the porosity of structures was calculated. the dissolution mechanisms are discussed at high hf/h2o2 ratio, which no formation of oxide is not formed at the surface and based on a localized hole injection from ag nanoparticles to si surface. at the level of ag nanoparticles, meso and macropores are formed correlating to the ag nanoparticle size. prior to enhancing the si dissolution, ag+ ions in the vicinity of si surface withdraw the electron from si and are deposited as ag nuclei. the stocked ag nuclei attract electrons from si because of higher electronegativity than si. in this approach, either sio2 is formed or si is etched as ag ions are reduced. these ag nanoparticles catalyzes si etching in hf/h2o2 solution. after metallization process, the si sample is etched in the hf and commonly h2o2 as oxidizing agent. therefore, the etching solutions is characterized by their molar ratio, named ρ = [ hf ] ( [ hf ] + [ h 2 o 2 ] ) . in the following, we select a solution (ρ ∼ 82%) reported in the literature conducting in the formation of porous si but we investigate the properties of porous si by varying etching time. etching time is an important factor that affect the kind of porous structures as high etching time produce large-area si nanowire arrays while macro and mesoporous structures are produced at short etching time. it has been investigated that the length of si nanowires formed by metal-assisted chemical etching in hf/h2o2 solution raised approximately linearly with the etching time. in addition, for the investigation of morphology, the distance between metal nanoparticles and patches incredibly affect the morphology of the porous structures. it was presented that the separated ag nanoparticles catalyze the etching isolated pores but for high density of ag nanoparticles (e.g., due to a raise in deposition time), they overlap and isolated wire structures were achieved. also, if the ag nanoparticles do not overlap, but are effectively close together, si nanowires might be fabricated [28,29]. 2.2 fabrication of n + ps/p silicon junctions at first step, as was shown at fig. 1 b the solution including of 3% p2o5 and 10−3\\u202fm triton as a surfactant was sprayed over nanoscopic silicon wafers. after that, nanoscopic wafers were dried at 250\\u202f°c for 20\\u202fmin. the diffusion process was performed at different diffusion temperatures and times. a d-optimal design of experiment was carried out at 2 levels to indicate the effect of the operation factors on the responses (voltage and current density). diffusion temperature (a) and diffusion time (b) were considered as autonomous factors at design constrains 930.00 ≤ a+2b ≤ 960.00. it was noticed that the range of constrains referred to usual range of time and temperature of diffusion process. the input variables on the experiment are called factors. the performance measures results of experiments are called responses [25]. the values of factors were given in table 1 . in eq. (1) and eq. (2) multinomial equations were applied to predict the responses (y1 and y2) as functions of autonomous factors and their interactions. in this study, the number of autonomous factors was 2, therefore the voltage response for the quadratic multinomial became (1) y 1 = β 0 + ∑ β i x i + ∑ β i i x i 2 + ∑ ∑ β i j x i x j and for the current response, the cubic multinomial became (2) y 2 = β 0 + ∑ β i x i + ∑ β i i x i 2 + ∑ β i i i x i i i 3 + ∑ ∑ β i j x i x j + ∑ ∑ β i j x i x j 2 + ∑ ∑ β i j x i 2 x j where β 0 . β i . β i i . β i i i . β i j were constant, linear, square, cubic and interaction regression coefficient terms, respectively; xi and xj are autonomous factors (a and b). interaction is presented when the effect of a factor on the response variable depends on the setting level of another factor [25]. in this study, 12 design points were obtained which had whole range of two factors but four of them were removed in order to achieve the normal plot of responses. the values of responses were given in table 2 . the results of d-optimal design were given in table 1 according to experiments. the above results had a confidence interval (ci) of 95% for model of both responses. in statistics, ci is a kind of interval estimation of normal plot and two main factors and also, is utilized to show the validity of a survey. the level of confidence of the ci shows the probability that the confidence range takes the valid population factors for a given distribution of models [30,31]. at third step, the diffused wafers were rinsed into diluted hf for 2–3s. finally, the contacts were fabricated on the diffused optimum sample and that was the result of d-optimal design of experiment. it should be noted that we fabricated the non-porous silicon solar cell for comparison between optimum porous silicon solar cell at the same condition. 3 characterization the surface morphologies of nanoscopic porous wafers were investigated via field emission scanning electron microscopy (fe-sem, mira3 tescan). the structural characterization of substrates was evaluated via x-ray diffractometer (xrd) system (x'pert highscore plus). design-expert 7 software was used for multi regression analysis, analysis of variance (anova), analysis of maximum of data in the response surface regression (regrs) method. also, the fit beauty of the model was estimated by the coefficient of determination (r2) and its statistical significance was investigated by the f-test. the optical properties of un-doped porous wafers were measured via cary eclipse photoluminescence spectroscopy. the reflectance curves were measured by phystec co spectroscopy. the electrical characterization was performed using the i–v by sharif solar simulator co under am 1.5\\u202fg spectral irradiance (100\\u202fmw/cm2 at 25\\u202f°c). 4 result and discussion in fig. 2 . fe-sem images demonstrate the comparison of surface morphologies of three porous substrates. it can be seen that the nanoscopic structures have been fabricated as curved shape and cylinders (measured by digimizer software) which have the average depth of 0.27, 0.34 and 0.4\\u202f μ m and the average diameter of 96.8, 99.8 and 183.4\\u202fnm, respectively. also, their porosities are achieved to 18%, 25%, and 42%, respectively using eq. (3). different times of etching process (90, 180 and 270s) lead to different surface morphologies shown in fig. 2a-c, respectively. the size and shape of metal nanoparticles affect the morphology and reflectance properties of textured silicon surface in metal-assisted chemical etching method [32]. also, the involved chemical reactions are incredibly complex and hard to control resulting in thin as well as inhomogeneous porous silicon structures [33]. it should be noted that the etching duration higher than 270s makes the demolished surface and shorter than 90s does not result in specific morphology (not shown here). these images clearly indicate that the average diameter of nanoscopic structures increases proportional to etching duration. as increasing the etching duration to 270s, the cylinder morphologies clearly become irregular inverted conical as shown in fig. 2 c. furthermore, with increasing etching time the depth of structures increases to 0.4\\u202f μ m.using etching solution with 70 < ρ < 100 and high proportion of hf, curved and straight cylindrical pores are formed with diameter matching the size of ag nanoparticles [34]. (3) porosity = m 1 − m 2 m 1 − m 3 × 100 % fig. 3 shows the xrd patterns of the silicon substrates etched at different times 90s, 180s, and 270s. the spectra of the non-porous silicon substrate are also included for comparison. xrd peaks of etched samples is close to non-porous silicon peak which is an evidence for crystallite structure of porous silicon. increasing etching time results in expansion of peak widths because of reduced crystallite size. the small peak around 38° could be attributed to formation of agf and agf2. the average crystallite size of substrates has been calculated using debye-scherrer formula [35]. the achieved values are 373, 59, and 24a° for the etching times of 90s, 180s, and 270s, respectively. the reduction in the crystallite size at high etching time can be driven from the enhancement of full wide at half maximum values at diffraction peaks that the achieved values are 767, 80, and 28a° for the etching time of 90s, 180s, and 270s, respectively. finally, the results of xrd show that the etched substrate at 180s has structural characterization among another substrates. fig. 4 shows that the pl intensity significantly increases by etching duration while does not affect peak positions. there is relevance between pl spectrum and the metal-assisted chemical etching method. the shifts in the pl spectra are related to the structural modifications of porous silicon layers fabricated by etching method. the pl intensity is incredibly increased by etching surface time which is correlated to increase of the silicon nanostructure density according to the quantum confinement prediction [36]. ledoux et al. had measured the photoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals and reported their yield that is as a function of nanocrystal sizes. they found that the results of photoluminescence followed the quantum-confinement model [37]. the pl spectra demonstrates emission peaks centered at two positions which are from right to left, green to blue, respectively. the first one situate in green region; while, the second one is more intense and correlate to emission in the blue region. the decrease of the crystallite size and the pore population are led the blue emission. it is found that the shift of pl peak to the green region at 545\\u202fnm can be correlated to formation of agf and agf2. these results also, are in agreement with xrd result that both emissions for 270s are the sharpest because of its crystallite size and concentration of agf and agf2 in its structure. the emission of two peaks is due to the presentation of various porous morphologies which have various radiative recombination centers [36]. also, it is seen that we have achieved to maximum and minimum values of etching range and the second one has a modified shape. anova results indicate significant models with adequate precisions of 13.435 and 73.141, respectively for voltage and current-density responses. adequate precision measures the signal to noise ratio, and a ratio greater than 4 is eligible [38]. here, the ratio is greater than 4 for both responses. the fitting quality of the equations is explained by the coefficient of regression adjusted r-squared or in better way by predicted r-squared. the adjusted r-squared values demonstrate variability in the observed response values which can be presented by the experimental factors and their interactions [38]. the predicted and adjusted r-squared values are closer to 1, indicating that the better fitting is attained. the predicted r-squared value of voltage and current-density responses are 0.6818 and 0.8226, respectively that are in reasonable adaption with 0.8897 and 0.9982 which are the adjusted r-squared values for voltage and current-density responses. the model f-values of 18.74 and 663.07 imply for voltage and current-density, respectively that the models are significant and there are only 0.13 and 0.15 chance for model responses that both model f-values could occur due to noise. to predict quadratic multinomial model for y1 the quadratic regression coefficients are given in eq. (5). the linear terms, interaction term and the quadratic terms of a and b are significant for y1 (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.05). (5) y 1 3 = 0.15 - 0.11a - 0.09b + 0.78ab + 0.43 a 2 + 0.37 b 2 in addition, to predict cubic multinomial model for y2 the cubic regression coefficients are given in eq. (6). the linear terms, the interaction term, the quadratic terms and the cubic terms of a and b are significant for y2 (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.05). (6) 1 y 2 + 0.2 = - 1.92 - 12.96a - 8.72b + 255.40ab + 141.32 a 2 + 116.06b2 - 633.18 a 2 b - 572.19 ab 2 - 230.05 a 3 - 173.31 b 3 validation of each factor is defined in the process for example, when the value of the sum of square increases, the importance of the corresponding factor increases in the following process [39]. it could be seen in table 3 and table 4 , respectively that the effect of b2 is highest in the model of voltage response and also in the model of current density response; the effect of a3 is the highest one. in fig. 5 a-b, the experimental values are accurately close to the predicted ones. if the data points be close to the straight line, the data are normally distributed [39]. by this mean that, our experiment data taken from a normal distribution. in fig. 6 . fe-sem images indicate the comparison of surface morphologies of porous substrates before and after diffusion in fabrication process of solar cell. it can be seen that the diffusion conditions (840°c-60min and 893.25°c-29.63min) does not have destructive effect on morphology of macro porous layers shown in fig. 6b-c, respectively. also, their diameters are calculated average value of 99.8\\u202fnm as same as before annealing. it should be noted that accordance with doe modeling, the diffusion condition of 840°c-60min is correlated to optimum solar cell and 893.25°c-29.63min condition is related to fair solar cell (not mentioned here). mesoporous silicon layer has been formed in outer part of n+ emitter of a p-n+ junction due to its instability at high annealing but the macro porous layer is fabricated on raw wafer just after the pre-texturization [40]. it is found that this structure is desirable to fabricate porous silicon solar cells. the potential properties of porous silicon have made this structure as a remarkable candidate which is beneficial for enhancing light-trapping potency in visible spectra [41]. the structure of matt black macroporous results in multiple reflection of light arrays on the pore walls, deducing in an improved ability of photon absorption and reduction of reflectivity [40]. the antireflection ability of our matt black silicon solar cell is indicated in fig. 7 . the reflectance varies over the wavelength range of 450–800\\u202fnm. as shown in fig. 7, the reflectance of both of them illustrates in their color region but peak of non-porous silicon solar cell is remarkably 600 times sharper than fabricated black silicon solar cell. for sinx coated solar cell, the incident wave is absorbed or transmitted into cell due to the phase opposition of considered wavelength and arc/substrate interface. but finally, some amount of incident wavelength is reflected because of internal reflection of interference [42]. while, for the black nanoscopic silicon solar cell, the exposed area is increased and because of the structure and morphology of surface nanostructured array, the light harvesting and also concentrated incoming light are incredibly enhanced near the surface in broad wavelength range [24]. p-n junction fabricates a selective barrier for intercepting charge carrier and making a pass way for holes and electrons to the p and n contacts, respectively [43,44]. the j-v curves of fabricated solar cell using optimized nanoscopic silicon and non-porous silicon are indicate in fig. 8 . singh et al. have investigated the influence of various phosphorous diffusion factors such as pre-diffusion temperature, drive-in temperature, process time on the emitter thickness and conversion efficiency of solar cells. they achieved that a low diffusion temperature has made a shallower emitter with value of 0.453μ. cell efficiency was strongly affected by emitter thickness. so that, efficiency of cells reported to be 10.81% and 7.62% for shallow and deep emitter cells respectively. in addition, they found that a great open circuit voltage was achieved for shallower emitter [45]. also, li et al. have reported that n+ emitters were formed in a liquid pocl3 tube furnace at a temperature of 850\\u202f°c [46]. our results show that by modeling and engineering the diffusion process on the optimum nanoscopic substrate, the optimum temperature and time are 840\\u202f°c and 60\\u202fmin, respectively. in this survey, we illustrate an effective diffusion scheme for nanoscopic black silicon fabricated by mace method. in our case porosity does not increase electric loss so much because of our result from non-porous silicon solar cell, made at the same fabrication process with porous silicon solar cell, indicate that the efficiency of porous silicon solar cell achieves to 13.64% in comparison to 11% for non-porous silicon solar cell. it is found that the appearance of structural defects and surface recombination reduce the open circuit voltage. although, the short circuit current density is increased due to increasing the light absorption properties of front surface. finally, the result overall the low reflectance effect has dominant influence on performance of solar cell as the same investigations [42,47]. the electrical loss which is caused by application of metal contacts on porous structures is minimized using thermal annealing process of contacts. here, the lattice mismatch between top-contacts and porous silicon is reduced and the stability of electrical contacts is enhanced. thus, the electrical loss is minimized. by incorporated the surface morphology modification, emitter optimization modeling and technique, the results of solar cells are given in table 5 . 5 conclusion in this paper, the modeling and engineering of the diffusion process on the nanoscopic silicon substrate were studied. the optimum etching duration for fabricating nano-structure silicon substrate for photovoltaic application had been found 180s caused to porosity of 25%, depth of 0.34\\u202fμm and diameter of 99.8\\u202fnm. by modeling and engineering the diffusion process on the nanoscopic substrate, it was determined that the optimum diffusion temperature and time were 840\\u202f°c and 60\\u202fmin, respectively. also, effective factors on the voltage and current-density responses were identified b2 and a3, respectively. also it is found that, the xrd result was in agreement with pl result in both of them by increasing the etching time, the crystallite size was reduced to around 24a°. in addition, formation of agf and agf2 is detected in both analysis while this impurity was vanished for 180s etching time. in addition, the competition between the black nanoscopic silicon solar cell and sinx coated solar cell showed that the black nanoscopic silicon solar cell significantly reduced the optical reflection losses 600 times less than sinx coated solar cell. finally, η of 13.64%, ff of 0.53, voc of 0.611\\u202fv and jsc of 43.43\\u202fma/cm2 were obtained to merge the modification of silicon surface morphology and optimization of diffusion process without any protective and passivation layer such as sio2/sinx. meanwhile, our result from non-porous silicon solar cell made at the same fabrication process with porous silicon solar cell indicated that the incorporation of nanostructures caused to an unavoidable increase in surface area, designing the structures with superior light-harvesting properties with minimal recombination loss played an important role to achieve high performance of 13.64% in comparison 11% for non-porous silicon solar cell. in this report, the temperature and duration of diffusion process were optimized for fabricating nanoscopic silicon solar cells using design of experiments (doe) technique. the performance of nanoscopic solar cells could be further improved by optimizing pre-deposition temperature, and gas flows as effective parameters on p-n junction and even other main factors of fabricated nanostructures like annealing temperature of nanoparticles, duration time of their deposition and concentration of etching solution as based silicon solar cells. acknowledgement we warmly thank hoshang azizi and mozhgan shavandi for their contribution. also, we appreciate pro. daniel biro for his

nano-textured surfaces have shown an anti-reflective effect, their surface passivation properties are found to be generally worse compared to standard micro-textured surfaces. here, a novel front surface design has been proposed and simulated to balance the photonic and electronic effects together. zro2 based texturing has been used along with sic-based front surface passivation for the suppression of interface recombination and improvement of open-circuit voltage (voc). the device under investigation shows record voc of 662 mv in the sub-10 μm-thick rear contact silicon solar cell. the presence of zro2 and sic significantly improves the optical as well as the electrical behavior of the device. the device exhibits external quantum efficiency (eqe) > 81% in the spectrum range of 320–720 nm wavelength spectrum with a maximum of 95.6% at wavelength 560 nm. these improvements lead to 15.7% efficient rear contact silicon solar cell, in the sub-10 μm-thick regime. in second approach power conversion efficiency (pce) of 21.6% has been achieved, by introducing the same front surface design to a 300 μm thick device. all the simulations have been done using calibrated software program in atlas device simulation. graphical abstract image 1 keywords absorption recombination solar cell silicon carbide (sic) zro2 1 introduction photovoltaic (pv) is a simple and elegant method of coupling the sun's energy. solar cells are exceptional in that they directly convert the incident solar radiation into electricity, with no pollution and noise, making them robust, reliable and long lasting. solar cells are attractive candidates for clean and renewable power [1]. silicon (si) is the most extensively used material for solar cell production due to its abundance, reliability, nontoxicity, and mature fabrication techniques. further, solar cell technology is a function of efficiency, cost, and a lifetime of the cell. hence, large-scale implementation is not economically feasible. to absorb the solar spectrum, the thickness of the planar cell is typically more than 100 μm [2]. this requirement results in higher cost. also, in order to increase the collection of the generated carriers, the dimension of the device should be comparable to the carrier diffusion length. thinner silicon solar cells with high efficiency are fruitful for cost-effective energy solution [3,4]. further, to maximize solar cell efficiency, it is necessary to optimize both, the device electrical characteristics and the optical absorption of thin devices [5,6]. nanostructuring has been projected as an appropriate method to make thin silicon an efficient absorber. however, these cells are not efficient due to auger and surface recombination as the surface to volume ratio of the cells is large. however, recently, methods to minimize the surface recombination for nanostructured based ∼300 μm thick devices have been presented which results in 20% and 22% efficient cells [7,8]. the pce of nanostructured si solar cell remains below 22.2% for thick devices [7,8] and below 11% for thin devices [9], except 13.7% and 15.7% reported in refs. [9,10] for the 10 μm thick devices. in previous work, a 14.3% efficient zro2 textured rear contact solar cell has been proposed. the work shows efficient photon absorption in the sub-10-μm-thick device [11]. zro2 is a material of great technology due to its outstanding mechanical and electrical properties and high dielectric constant. large band gap (eg ∼ 6ev) and dielectric properties (ɛ ∼ 25) suggested its potential to replace sio2 in the advance semiconductor device and optical applications [12]. also, it has an excellent thermal stability. this work further extends the study of zro2 textured front surface based rear contact silicon solar cell having thin defect free sic layer at the zro2/si interface. the presence of thin sic layer minimizes the reflectivity [13,14]. previous work shows, embedding 3c-sic nanoparticles significantly reduces the photo reflectivity in uv/visible spectrum region [15]. the sic is an indirect (eg = 2.2 ev) semiconductor with wide energy band gap, high thermal conductivity, large breakdown field, and high saturation velocity make this material an ideal choice for high temperature, high power, high voltage electron devices. its high melting point, chemical inertness, high wear resistance, and extreme hardness, make it possible to fabricate sensors and actuators capable of performing in harsh environments [16]. the sic film formation has been done for si solar cell passivation. the film was deposited on silicon (100) and glass substrates by an rf magnetron co-sputtering system [17]. recently, sic passivated sige wafer based rear contact solar cells have been proposed for ultra-high efficiency in sub 10 μm thick devices; work shows improved optical absorption without the need of complex texturing [18,19]. moreover, this work shows that the presence of sic improves the photovoltaic parameters of zro2 based rear contact solar cell. the discussed device shows jsc and voc of 29.3 ma cm−2, 662 mv respectively. this results, in 15.7% pce in sub 10-μm thick solar cell, which is equivalent to the experimentally achieved record pce of 15.7% using periodic nanostructure [10]. however, present work shows superior voc, which shows that the surface recombination issue has truly been solved and sic passivation based nanostructured silicon solar cell have real potential for industrial production. the rear contact silicon solar cell has been selected because it is a promising high-efficiency solar cell having both, junction and the electrodes at the back side of the device. now, since the junction and contacts are on the back side, front surface can be designed for optimum optical performance [20]. 2 device structure and simulation in this section, the calibrated software program is written in silvaco atlas device simulator as per the results reported by (sangmoo jeong et al., 2013) for 10 μm thick rear contact solar cell with antireflection (ar) coating [9]. the dimensions and the doping density of the planar device were identical to the referenced cell and named as device a as shown in fig. 1 . the device geometry in the simulation was (50-μm-wide pitch, 46 μm-wide p+, and 30-μm-wide n+). the substrate was n-type, with doping density (3 × 1015 cm−3). p+ region was doped with boron (4 × 1020 cm−3, depth of 300 nm). n+ region was doped with phosphorous (1 × 1020 cm−3, depth of 100 nm). further, in the presence of heavy doping, (>1018 cm−3), experimental work has shown that the pn product in silicon turns out to be doping dependent [21]. as the doping level rises, a decrease in the bandgap occurs, where the valence band raises by the approximately same amount as the conduction band is lowered. discussed structure has heavily doped p and n regions, and so bandgap narrowing effects are enabled. these effects can be described by an analytic expression relating the variation in the bandgap, δeg to the doping concentration, n [22]. furthermore, the solar cells are the carrier recombination affected devices. therefore, auger and shockley- read- hall (srh) recombination models are selected during the simulation. phonon transitions occur in the presence of a trap or defect within the forbidden gap of the semiconductor [23,24]. basic for the srh model are the assumptions of one trap level in the forbidden band and drift-diffusion assumption for the transport of electrons and holes, and the assumption that the dynamics of the trapped carrier is quasi-stationary [25]. auger recombination occurs through a three particle transition whereby a mobile carrier is either captured or emitted. the underlying physics of such processes is unclear, and normally a more qualitative understanding is sufficient [26]. the auger coefficients, c p = 9.9 × 10−32 cm6 s−1 and c n = 2.8 × 10−31 cm6 s−1 have been used for p-type and n-type silicon, respectively, at 300 k temperature [27]. the concentration dependent mobility and field dependent mobility models have also been selected during simulation. the consistent set of models and parameters for the simulation of si solar cell have been used as suggested in already published article [28]. to obtain the current density (j)- voltage (v) curve under illumination, the standard am1.5 solar spectrum has been used. also, as the contact interface between metal and semiconductor is highly doped both for the p+ and n+ region i.e. ∼1020 cm−3, therefore, the ohmic contacts are used in this work. this has been done to avoid schottky barriers, and thus unnecessarily higher computation time. result reveals, the software program, is well calibrated within the acceptable range shown in table 1 . 3 results the result section is divided into two parts, first, designing a zro2 textured and thin sic-based zro2 textured 10 × 10 μm thick n-type silicon wafer for optimal spectrum response and second, the designed zro2 pattern with and without sic has been introduced to device a, by removing anti-reflective coating (arc) layer. zro2 textured 10 μm thick rear contact silicon solar cell is called as device b, and zro2 textured device with sic layer at the zro2/n-si interface is termed as device c. 3.1 spectrum response of zro2 textured sic-based silicon wafer in this section, a 10 × 10 μm thick n-type si wafer without arc, with arc, textured zro2 and textured zro2 having sic (20 nm) layer at zro2/n-si interface have been designed and simulated to obtain the spectrum response. the entire front surface is covered with repeated zro2 facet structures and optimized height, 175 nm, and width, 250 nm is used for texturing. the smaller and larger width size than 250 nm will show lower optical coupling and lower conversion efficiency, as suggested in ref. [29]. in the real cell, the nanopatterns can be fabricated via inexpensive and scalable imprinting technique. the complex refractive index of various materials has been obtained from sopra database [30] and presented in fig. 2 (a–b). fig. 2a shows, as wavelength changes from 300 to 1200 nm, the reflective index, n of zro2 changes from 2.45 to 2.17. the n values of zro2 are close to the n values of nitride, which is usually used as ar coating for silicon solar cell [31–33]. further, the spectral response of si wafers is presented in fig. 3 (a–b). result shows, planar silicon wafer without coating is highly reflective i.e. absorption is small in the range of 300–1000 nm wavelength spectrum. also, arc coating based si wafer shows >96% absorption in the spectrum range of 500–625 nm wavelength. lower and higher wavelength response is however not remarkable. the zro2 textured wafer shows improved optical behavior compared to arc coating based wafer due to anti-reflection and light scattering. this concludes that higher absorption is achieved in the zro2 textured wafer, which further results in higher available photocurrent shown in fig. 3b. results also indicate that throughout the spectrum range (300–1000 nm), zro2 textured wafer shows enhanced absorption as compared to arc coated wafer. at a wavelength equivalent to 300 nm, 77% absorption is achieved in the silicon wafer. also, photon absorption >82% has been achieved in the spectrum range of 325–850 nm wavelength with a maximum of 98.2%. this shows spectrum response has been improved due to zro2 textured front surface. further, optical behavior of sic-based zro2 textured wafer has also been obtained. the efficiency of a solar cell is directly related to the amount of light entering the cell. antireflection coating is used to reduce the reflection of the useful light while not absorbing it. our previous work shows that the photon coupling in underlying substrate is higher for 20 nm thick sic-based device. whereas, increasing the sic thickness results in parasitic absorbance in sic, and lower photon coupling in underlying substrate. since, absorbance directly depends on the thickness of the material. this further results in lower short circuit current density and power conversion efficiency [18]. therefore, the thickness of sic used in the simulation is only 20 nm whose absorption is negligible hence, optical coupling in underlying silicon is higher. also, the optical properties i.e. refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) required for an ar coating depends on the refractive index of the underlying substrate, encapsulated cover, and the operating wavelengths. the material having low absorption of useful light is needed, to reduce the absorption of useful light in arc. therefore, low k values are required, k value of 0.01 corresponds to less than 1% absorption, since α = 4пk/λ. fig. 2a and b shows that sic has n between 2.9 and 2.5 in the spectrum range of 300–1200 nm and k of less than 0.01 for the wavelengths greater than 430 nm. also, according to the patented work of allen et al. [34] sic film having n between 2.7 and 2.3 and k of less than 0.01 at a wavelength of 630 nm is a good candidate for antireflective coating for solar cells. this confirms that presence of sic will not degrade the optical behaviors of zro2 based wafer. furthermore, a contour plot of photons absorption rate in the wafers is also shown in fig. 4(a–d). higher photon coupling has been observed in both zro2 based and sic- based zro2 textured wafer. this results in higher absorption rate as well as higher absorption depth compared to arc based device, as shown in fig. 4c and d and fig. 4g and h. 3.2 rear-contact solar cell with zro2 textured front surface spectral results as discussed shows that the optical performance of si wafer is significantly improved in the case of zro2 textured front surface. therefore, arc coating of device a is replaced with zro2 textured front surface with rest of the device parameters being the same. in this section, the performance of two zro2 textured solar cells has been obtained, one with 20 nm thick sic layer at the interface (device b) and another without sic layer at the interface (device c). also, the results of the devices are compared with planar rear contact device as shown in fig. 1. here, device b and device c have been simulated with the help of calibrated program written for device a. results of previous section shows, an amalgamation of thin sic layer does not degrade the optical behavior of the wafer. hence, both the devices i.e. device b and device c shows significant improvement in device photovoltaic parameters: in terms of short circuit current density (jsc), voc, fill factor (ff), and pce compared to device a. fig. 5 (a–f), shows the contour plot of recombination rate in device a, device b, and device c, respectively. the device architecture is such that the holes generated at point 1, in fig. 1 need to travel shorter to arrive at n — p+ interface, whereas the holes generated at point 2, needs to travel a greater lateral distance. under short-circuit condition, a space charge region is formed around the junction having an associated electric field that collects the generated electron-hole pairs, and the collection is complete near p+ region. however, outside the p+ region, the substrate is neutral, and the collection will be by diffusion of electrons and holes towards the field region where they will be collected and separated. the electrons and holes generated in a region greater than the diffusion length will never reach the junction, and the recombination process will balance out. this results in higher recombination rate in region ii compared to the region i, shown in fig. 5. further, fig. 5c and f shows that significant improvement in surface recombination has been obtained in device c compared to device a and device b. the analysis reveals that recombination rate near the sic/n-si interface is small compared to the bulk region (n-si) of the device. the presence of sic creates an electric field at the interface and is directed from sic to si, rendering it energetically unfavorable for holes transport to sic/n-si interface, resulting in a low concentration of holes at the passivating interface [18,35]. thus, sinking the holes concentration at the interface will produce higher concentration difference between electrons and holes, and results in lower surface recombination rate [36]. results conclude that presence of zro2 textured front surface increases the optical response and presence of sic at the zro2/n-si interface minimizes the surface recombination. therefore, the dual advantage has been obtained with the help of sic and zro2. further, the j-v curve is presented in fig. 6 , for device a, device b, and device c, respectively. also, the photovoltaic parameters are concluded in table 1. the j-v curve of device a is identical to the j-v curve of the planar 10-μm-thick solar cell with anti-reflection (ar) layer, presented by (sangmoo jeong et al., 2013) [9]. this also validates the calibration of the software program. moreover, lower recombination and higher photogeneration lead to improved jsc and voc in device b and device c compared to device a. the jsc, voc of 28.6 ma cm−2, 623 mv, and 29.3 ma cm−2, 662 mv have been obtained in device b and device c, respectively, as shown in fig. 6. hence, 32% higher jsc and 7% higher voc has been obtained in device c compared to device a. also, the voc of the device c is 6% higher compared to device b which shows that the presence of sic in zro2 textured rear contact device significantly boost the photovoltaic performance of the device by suppressing the surface recombination. the overall pce of the device c is 42% and 11% higher compared to device a and device b respectively. moreover, the impact of minority carrier lifetime has been studied to obtain the effect of material quality on photovoltaic parameters, and the results are presented in fig. 7 (a–d). the discussed device is thin compared to conventional silicon solar cells and hence, the device can be fabricated with inexpensive, less pure material. also, the charge carriers in discussed device need to diffuse shorter length whereas, in conventional rear contact device, a long carrier lifetime is required to collect the carrier because the thickness is usually >150 μm. this results in, increased module cost since high-purity material is required. results show that the impact of minority carrier lifetime is negligible on all the three devices. however, the overall photovoltaic parameters of the device c are superior compared to device a and device b. at τ equivalent to 10−2 s, the pce of 11.3%, 14.7%, and 16.5% have been obtained in device a, device b, and device c respectively, whereas, for τ equivalent to 10−5 s, the values are 11.0%, 14.4%, and 15.7%, respectively. this shows only 4% change in pce is observed for device c, as carrier lifetime changes from 10−2 s to 10−5 s. all the photovoltaic parameters of device c are good compared to device a and device b as shown in fig. 7 (a–d). 3.3 sic- based zro2 textured 300 μm thick rear contact solar cell the results of the previous section show that the performance of silicon solar cell is improved with the help of sic- based zro2 texturing, however, optical absorption falls to lower values in the wavelength range of 900–100 nm, whereas simulated spectrum goes up to 1200 nm. the absorption coefficient of silicon is small at higher wavelength [37,38] and hence to increase the absorption up to 1200 nm, thicker silicon is required. therefore, a 300 μm thick sic-based zro2 textured rear contact solar cell has also been designed and its optical, as well as electrical parameters, are compared with 10 μm thick device as discussed in previous sections. fig. 8 show the optical behavior of the devices i.e. 10 μm and 300 μm thick devices, respectively. the available photocurrent is shown in fig. 8a along with source photocurrent of the spectrum. improved available photocurrent has also been obtained in 300 μm thick device in higher wavelength regime. the eqes of the two devices have also been obtained and presented in fig. 8b. results show, significant improvement in the higher wavelength region. the eqe fall to lower values at higher wavelength compared to 10-μm thick device, as shown in fig. 8b. further, j-v curve of the devices is shown in fig. 9 . results indicate that improved optical response of 300 μm thick device leads to significant improvement in jsc. the minority carrier lifetime of 1 ms has been selected for the thicker device to prevent the bulk recombination of generated carriers. the jsc (39.40 ma cm−2), voc (687 mv), ff (80%), and pce (21.6%) have been obtained. in experimental work, modulated surface textured (mst) based rear contact device shows jsc, voc, ff, and pce values of 40.5 ma cm−2, 635 mv, 77%, and 19.8%, respectively [7]. this shows that simulated results are in good agreement with experimental results. the voc value of the experimental device is lower compared to the device under investigation. this concludes that the optimum surface passivation has been achieved in this work compared to experimental results due to the presence of sic. this shows that the amalgamation of sic in experimental devices can significantly suppress the carrier recombination at the interface and lead to higher open circuit voltage. the photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in table 2 along with already available experimental results. 4 conclusions this work presents an efficient optical absorption and improved surface passivation in sub-10 μm-thick si solar cell device. zro2 and sic based front surface are designed for the silicon wafer, and spectrum response is obtained. the wafer shows absorption (87%) at short wavelengths (300 nm). results show that throughout the wavelength spectrum 300–1000 nm i.e. (uv–visible–infrared), zro2 textured wafer having thin sic at the interface (zro2/n-si) shows significant improvement in optical absorption. hence, zro2 textured sic-based rear contact solar cell has been designed and simulated to achieve lower interface recombination and improved open-circuit voltage (voc). this results in enhanced photovoltaic parameters compared to the conventional rear contact solar cell with ar coating. the jsc and voc of 29.3 ma cm−2, 661 mv have been obtained. this results in 15.7% pce in the sub-10 μm-thick rear contact silicon solar cell. further, a 21.6% efficient 300 μm thick device has also been designed and simulated. results show that if fabricated experimentally it can prove to be a cost-effective solution for energy efficient applications. acknowledgment the authors would

dai, 2018; jihun et al., 2012; liu et al., 2014; mrazkova, 2018; peng, 2006; toor et al., 2015; q. wang, 2017; wang, 2018; y. wang, 2017; yu, 2013; zhang, 2019; zheng, 2017; barron, 2018). solar energy resources are widely distributed and inexhaustible. therefore, compared with new generation technologies such as wind energy and biomass energy, photovoltaic power generation is a renewable energy generation technology with the most desirable characteristics of sustainable development (with the most abundant resources and the cleanest generation process). it is of great interest in lowering the materials and manufacturing costs of solar cell technology. diamond wire saw (dws) is a wafering technology that developed to replace the slurry wire saw (sws). the advantage of dws wafering technology is that the resulted wafer thickness is uniform and, most importantly, much lower fragment rate than that by sws technology. thus, dws wafering technology exhibits very high throughput while lowering the usage of consumables such as slurry and wire. however, the surface of dws silicon wafer is so smooth that the reflectivity is very high, as a result, conventional acid method is difficult to texture the surface of silicon wafer (dai, 2018; su, 2018; zhang, 2019; su, 2018; wu, 2018). ag-metal assisted chemical etching method (ag-mace) is developed to texture the surface of silicon wafer in recent years. silicon wafer textured by ag-mace are called black silicon. because it has a very low reflectivity, as low as 1% (huang, 2011; jiang, 2017; li, 2020; li and bohn, 2000; liu, 2015; toor et al., 2015; volk, 2015; wang, 2017; yuan, 2009; he et al., 2012; sarneta et al., 2012). for dws technology, the emeries are fixed to the diamond wire, and they cannot roll freely between the wafer and the wafer, as a result, the wafers are covered with stripe saw damage layer (fig. 1 ). because of the stripe saw damage layer, heterogeneous surface morphology is observed for the silicon wafer, as shown in fig. 2 . and the defects are concentrated in the top of the stripe damage layer. the experimental results indicated that the stripe saw damage layer had a significant impact on the preparation of black silicon by influencing the deposition of silver nanoparticles on silicon wafer. it is necessary to remove completely the stripe saw damage layer from the silicon surface. currently, the common method is etching in koh solution at a high temperature. this method can remove the saw damage layer on the wafer, but the surface of the silicon wafers produced will have a lot of white spots (papet, 2006). for ag-mace, how to remove completely the saw damage layer on the surface of the dws multi-crystalline silicon (mc-si) is critical for obtaining high quality black silicon and high efficiency mc-si solar cells. the reaction process of ag-mace is shown in fig. 3 . the wafers were first immersed in a solution of hf and agno3. since the silver ions are more potential than the silicon atoms, redox reactions occur between them (peng, 2006). the silver ions are reduced to silver nanoparticles and deposited on the surface of the silicon wafers. because of the presence of silver nanoparticles on the silicon wafers, electrochemical reactions occur on the surface of the silicon wafers when immersed in a solution containing hf and h2o2 (huang, 2011; cao, 2015; toor, 2016; huang, 2010; wang, 2015; campbell and green, 2001). the electrons in the silicon are transported from the surface of the silicon wafers to ag nanoparticles and recombined by the holes. as a result, the si is oxidized to sio2 which is etched by hf. the mentioned reactions resulted a pit beneath the ag nanoparticles. and the ag nanoparticles then fall into the pits. along with the reaction, the pits become deeper and deeper, and, eventually nano-pores are formed on the si wafers. these are the basic principles of ag-mace. however, this reaction takes place on an ideal surface (assuming the surface is flat). in fact, there is a saw damage layer on the surface of the silicon wafers. this damage layer (as shown in fig. 3) is not conducive to the uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the silicon wafers. hot koh solution is usually used in mass production line to remove the saw damage layer. the chemical reaction equation is shown in eq. (1) (zhang, 2019; yang, 2017). the reaction produces large amounts of hydrogen, which forms bubbles cling to the surface of the wafers (papet, 2006). these bubbles prevent the koh from continuing to react with the silicon wafers, resulting in the incomplete removal of the saw damage layer in these areas. (1) si + 2 o h - + h 2 o = si o 3 2 - + 2 h 2 ↑ prior to this work, members of our group had done a lot of research on multi-crystalline black silicon, developing sever additives with different functions (li, 2020a, 2020b). each additive solves a specific process problem in production. it is the organic combination of these additives that make it possible to production high-quality black silicon. in this work, we develop an additive that will be more advanced in this approach. the influence of white spots on silicon wafers and the subsequent deposition of silver nanoparticles were studied. and, the influence of these white spots on the solar cell performance was analyzed. an environmentally friendly and cheap chemical additive was developed to assist in etching silicon wafers to remove the white spots. the chemical mechanism of the additive assisted reaction was analyzed. finally, high quality black silicon was fabricated. the resulted black silicon solar cell showed a uniform appearance and exhibited an average efficiency (ŋ) of 19.15%. this is an improvement of 0.4 percentage points over normal solar cells without additives. and which makes this work meaningful to in improving the quality of solar cells and reduce the production cost. 2 experimental the experiment was conducted using commercially available dws mc-si wafers (156.75 × 156.75 mm2). its doping is p-type, with a thickness of 200 ± 20 µm and resistivity of 1–3 ω·cm. fig. 4 is a schematic diagram of experimental process steps (labeled step1 to step9 in turn). in order to investigate the influence of saw damage layer on the performance of black silicon solar cells, experiments were designed. there were nine process steps included, and two group of samples were prepared. in one group, additive was adopted in step 1 to remove the saw damage layer (labeled as step1-a) and no additive was used in another group (labeled as step1-b). except for the first step, the process conditions for all other steps were kept constant. the samples processed in step1-a is named the additive group, and samples processed in step1-b is named the control group. the main purpose of step1 is to remove the saw damage layer on the surface of bare si. the step2 is to deposit silver nanoparticles on the surface of the silicon wafer. step3 is to etch nanostructures on the surface of the silicon processed in step2. then the silicon wafer is processed in step4 to enlarge the nano-pores. it is important to note that these wafers must be treated by h2o2 and nh3·h2o solution after step4 to remove the remaining silver nanoparticles on the wafer surface (step5), especially from the nano-pores. the wafers must be soaked in running water for at least a minute after each process. the wafers are then dried in nitrogen-protected environment. at this point, the fabrication of black silicon wafers was finished. thereafter, these black silicon wafers are then used to make solar cells in the following steps: phosphorus diffusion to form pn junction (step6), psg removing and edge etching (step7), sinx coating by pecvd (step8), screen printing and firing to form metal contacts (step9). the test equipment required for the experiment mainly includes the following: scanning electron microscopy (sem, hitachi, s4800), which is used to characterized the surface morphology of silicon wafer; semilab pv-2000, for conducting the surface minority carrier lifetime mapping; lighted current–voltage (i-v) measurement system (under am1.5g, r. t.) for output performance of solar cells. 3 results and discussion in the process of industrial production, hundreds of silicon wafers are immersed in a wet etching bench of several hundred liters at one time. every silicon wafers parallel to another one. the space between them in wet etching bench is very small, only about a millimeter. when such a large number of silicon wafers simultaneously undergo a violent chemical reaction in the solution, the large number of bubbles generated instantaneously in such a narrow space cannot be expelled immediately. in this work, an additive is developed to solve the problem of hydrogen bubbles. the additive is mainly consisted by cyclodextrin and lignosulfonate, which are mixed in a certain proportion. among them, cyclodextrin has the property of dehydrogenation, and it has a high affinity with the hydrogen formed in the reaction process. this reduces the probability of large bubbles formed during the reaction. another substance is lignosulfonate, which can effectively reduce the viscosity of the solution and thus relieve the surface tension of the solution. it makes it easier for bubbles created during the reaction to detach from the surface of the silicon wafer. the combination of the two substances can make the bubbles released from the surface of the silicon wafer faster and more uniformly. therefore, it can better remove mechanical impurities, fingerprints and other contaminated materials on the silicon wafer. the surface of silicon wafer treated with this additive presents a uniform positive pyramid structure. the surface structure is more favorable for the subsequent deposition of silver nanoparticles on the silicon wafer and thus, a uniform porous structure can be obtained on the silicon wafer surface. as can be seen from fig. 5 , additive group of silicon wafers have a uniform and aesthetic appearance (fig. 5(a)). control group, on the other hand, has lots of white spots and even some smudges on the surface of wafers (fig. 5(b)). it can be seen that white spots are mainly located at the central part of the wafer, while little can be observed at the edge of the wafer. the reason can be explained by considering the generation and desorption of the hydrogen bubbles. during the chemical reaction, the bubbles generated close to the edge of wafers can be released quickly. on the contrary, there is less space in the central part of the wafers, and the bubbles created by chemical reactions cannot be released immediately. thus, many of them stick to the silicon wafer, preventing the reaction between wafers and the solution, as a result, lots of white spots are formed on the surface of wafers. fig. 6 (a) and fig. 6(b) shows the sem images of additive group and local area of control group without white spots, respectively. it can be seen that these areas are covered with uniform pyramidal structure. in contrast, fig. 6(c) shows the sem images of control group with white spots on the surface, and the stripe saw damage layer is still observed on the sample surface. saw damage layer has great effect on the deposition of silver nanoparticles. because the saw damage layer is filled with dense defects, these defects are higher in energy. this means that the more energetic the silicon atom, the less stable it is, the more likely it is to react with other substances. in our experiment, the deposition of silver nanoparticles is a redox reaction. on the surface of the silicon wafers, the more energetic the silicon atoms are, the easier it is to redox with the silver ions, which are reduced to silver nanoparticles. so in theory, silver nanoparticles are preferentially redox with high-energy silicon atoms and deposit on those high-energy silicon atoms. as shown in fig. 7 , the silicon wafers used in the first and third rows are treated with additive, and their saw damage layers are removed cleanly. the wafers in the second and fourth rows, which are not treated with additives, have white spots on their surfaces. an obvious phenomenon is that the deposition of silver nanoparticles in the first and third rows is much more uniform than that in the second and fourth rows. in other words, silver nanoparticles are deposited inhomogeneously on the surface of the silicon wafers if the saw damage layer is not removed cleanly, regardless of the deposition time or the concentration of silver ions. this heterogeneity includes not only the distribution of silver nanoparticles, but also the size of silver nanoparticles. in each column, the concentration of silver ions is the same. the deposition time of the top two rows was 30 s, and that of the bottom two rows was 120 s. at the same concentration of silver ions, the inhomogeneity becomes more significant with the increase of deposition time. this is because the silver nanoparticles in the defect grow fast, and where there are no defects (i.e. the damaged layer is removed cleanly), the silver nanoparticles grow slowly. so over time, the silver nanoparticles at the defective area grow larger than those at the less defective sites. in every row, the concentration of silver ions is increased gradually. the same tendency can be obtained from the fig. 7. given the same deposition time, the higher the concentration of silver ions, the greater difference in the uniformity of the silver nanoparticles on the surface of the silicon wafers where the saw damage layer has not been cleanly removed. when the deposition time is 30 s, and the silver ion concentration is larger than 0.08 g/l, obvious difference can be observed for the deposited silver nanoparticles. when the deposition time is 120 s, the non-uniformity of deposited silver nanoparticles is more significant, even for the ag+ concentration as low as 0.01 g/l. these results strongly prove that the saw damage layer on the surface of silicon wafers will seriously affect the uniformity of silver nanoparticles deposited on the surface of silicon wafer. therefore, the additive we developed can remove the saw damage layer and be beneficial for the silver nanoparticles deposited uniformly on the surface of the silicon wafers. this is critical for the next step in the preparation of high quality black silicon. fig. 8 shows the surface morphology of black silicon samples in additive group and control group, respectively. as can be seen from fig. 8(a), with the assistant of additive, saw damage layer is completely removed and the fabricated nanopores are very uniform. on the contrary, there is still saw damage layer on the surface of the final black silicon wafer, as shown in fig. 8(b). that is to say, the saw damage layer is not removed in step 1, and it is difficult to remove it later. because the deposition of silver nanoparticles is not uniform, the majority of silver nanoparticles are deposited in a small part of the high energy saw damage layer. elsewhere, silver nanoparticles were deposited in small quantities and small volumes. therefore, in the following electrochemical catalytic etching reaction, only those places where more and larger silver nanoparticles are deposited can be etched into nano-pore structure. the saw damage layer around the large silver nanoparticles, however, is preserved because there are no silver nanoparticles (inside the circle in fig 0.8(b)). effective minority carrier lifetime mapping is performed for black silicon samples which are fabricated by double-phosphorus diffusion, double-sided psg removal and double-sided sinx coating by pecvd. although the size of the sample is 156.75 × 156.75 mm2, but the actual testing area is 140 × 140 mm2 schüler et al., 2012. the measured results are displayed in fig. 9 and table 1 . these defective saw damage layers are deadly recombination centers for solar cells. this conclusion can be verified by effective minority carrier lifetime mapping. as shown in fig. 9(b), the central portion of the silicon wafer has a lower minority carrier lifetime, that is, the red areas in the figure. this corresponds to the white speckled area in fig. 5(b). these saw damage layers that have not been removed cleanly will not be passivated effectively in the subsequent coating by pecvd. as a result, the minority carrier lifetime in these regions are lower than that elsewhere. as shown in fig. 9(a), the distribution of minority carrier lifetime is just the opposite. the minority carrier lifetime in the central region is high, while the minority carrier lifetime in the marginal region is low. table 1 is the statistics of the number of minority carrier lifetime distribution for the whole silicon wafers, and the obvious differences can also be seen here. the average effective minority carrier lifetime of the additive group was twice as high as that of the control group. this difference is mainly reflected in the surface recombination speed (save) of silicon wafer. as shown in eq. (2), τeff is the effective minority carrier life, that is τave in the table 1, and τbulk is the bulk minority carrier lifetime of the material. generally speaking, given a material, the τbulk of the matrial will not change. s is the surface recombination velocity, that is, save in the table 1. w is the thickness of the silicon wafer. according to the eq. (2), the higher the surface recombination velocity, the lower the effective minority carrier life. this is why the effective minority carrier lifetime of control group is much lower than that of additive group. (3.1) 1 τ eff = 1 τ bulk + 2 s w electroluminescence (el) image is measured for the two group of samples to further investigate the influence of residual saw damage layer. as shown in fig. 10 (b), there are many dark areas in the el image of the control group, and they are also concentrated in the center of the cell. these dark signals are consistent with the distribution of minority carrier lifetime of silicon wafer as well as those white spot mentioned above. because the residual saw damage layer on the silicon wafer can lead to severe surface recombination, it can cause poor luminescence during el testing. whereas, the el image of the additive group (fig. 10(a)) is comparatively bright. thus, the el images in fig. 10 demonstrate that the surface recombination rate of additive group is effectively lowered by completely removing the saw damage layer on the silicon wafer. the detailed electric performance parameters and the iv curves of the two group cells are shown in table 2 and fig. 11 respectively. compared with the data in the table 2, the voc of the additive group (635.58 v) was 8 mv higher than that of the control group (628.19 v). the main reason for the lower voc of control group is that the surface recombination of control group silicon wafer is more serious than that of additive grioup. the rsh of the latter (49.45 ω) is much lower than that of the former (383.05 ω), which is too low for solar cells. the reason that the shunt resistance of control group is much smaller than that of additive group is that the leakage of control group is very serious. this can be verified from the battery’ reverse leakage of battery parameters. the irev1 and the irev2 refer to the reverse leakage current of solar cells at different bias (irev1 corresponds to a bias of −10 v and irev2 corresponds to a bias of −12 v). the greater the reverse leakage current, the more serious the solar cell leakage, the worse the performance. for irev1, the control group (0.24 ma) is 4.71 times the additive group (0.05 ma). and for irev2, the former (0. 56 ma) is 7.04 times the later (0.08 ma). because the saw damage layer of control group is not removed cleanly. on the one hand, the residual saw damage layer itself is a place with numerous defects, which will cause serious surface recombination, which will lead to serious leakage. on the other hand, the residual saw damage layer can lead to heterogeneous deposition of silver nanoparticles. this will cause the heterogeneous textring of the silicon wafer. the heterogeneous texturing will seriously affect the phosphorus diffusion effect, the passivation effect of the sinx film and the surface recombination of the solar cells. finally, the average efficiency of the solar cells in additive group (19.15%) was 0.4% absolutely higher than that of control group (18.75%). for maximum efficiency, the former (19.46%) is 0.46% absolutely higher than the latter (19.03%). those results undoutedly suggest the developed additive is very useful for fabricating high efficiency black silicon solar cells. 4 conclusion during the mass production of black silicon solar cells, it is found that the saw damage layer on the surface of dws mc-si wafer cannot be removed completely due to the hydrogen bubbles. the residual saw damage layer not only affects the uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles but also leads to high surface recombination rate of the cell devices. in this work, an additive is developed to assist the release of hydrogen bubbles. the experimental results show that with the assist of additive, saw damage layer can be removed completely, and high quality black silicon can be fabricated subsequently. the achieved black silicon exhibited higher carrier lifetime than that of samples without using additive, and finally, high performance black silicon solar cells are prepared on large area mc-si wafers, with highest efficiency of 19.49% and average efficiency of 19.15%. the results suggest that the additive developed in this work is beneficial to fabricate high efficiency black silicon solar cells in mass production. declaration of competing interest i declare that all of us
