    "1. abstract classfication 可以达到93.75% recall score,因为只有倒数第五篇文章（Forming submicron in micron texture on the diamond-wire- sawn mc-Si wafer by introducing artificial defects）无法进行分类 -- 该文章未在提供的.txt里出现；-- 因此，这是可以得到的最高recall分数，无法比这个更高了，除非增加新的标注文章；\n",
    "2. title classification可以达到87.5% recall score，倒数第二篇（Suppression of surface and Auger recombination by formation and control of radial junction in silicon microwire solar cells）和倒数第五篇（未在提供的.txt里出现) 没有被成功分类；\n",
    "3. 初步结论：使用‘%’ occurs at abstract分类; 但数据量（265篇）相较预估的100篇左右多太多，因此考虑在这些文章中存在大量not ok articles，所以对not ok example进行idf分析，查看在not ok example里面出现最多的词是什么，并以此来作为过滤条件"
